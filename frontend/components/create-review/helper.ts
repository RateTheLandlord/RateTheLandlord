export const sheldonReview = 'Sheldon Rakowsky and his agent Gary Harrison didn\'t respect privacy, Garry Harrison broke in a total of 9 times without notice or permission to enter. Sheldon and Garry had also violated my personal information by using my emergency contacts to harrass my mother everyday for a week. They have also harrassed the security of the building everyday to ask for information about me instead of getting in contact with me through my emails which he had to contact me along with my number. Building securities supervisor was also there when Garry Harrison broke in back in August of last year and nothing was done to address that breach of privacy and rights. Should have known rights would be violated from the beginning when Sheldon Rakowsky asked for 6 months rent up front on a Draft of a total of 11,900.00 and the next 6 months on post dated cheques. After the first year, rent was covered on post dated cheques and he didn\'t give me a new rental agreement for the next years and it got in the way of government documentation by making it difficult to get IDs renewed with the address and student information verified. Sheldon Rakowsky has also evicted me without warning or notice and there was nothing I could do about it, they only gave me 3 days to get my belongings and I was to get in touch with Garry Harrison to get access to my stuff within those 3 days. I tried to get in contact and was ignored, the next day Garry Harrison got back to me to tell me within the last 3 days my belongings were removed because I missed the window to get them. Sheldon was kind enough to store them in a garbage but he didn\'t pack all of my belongings, my furniture and small appliances that I bought were kept by Sheldon Rakowsky. So was some of my other things such as expensive perfume, balcony furniture, dumbells, barbells and kettlebell.'
