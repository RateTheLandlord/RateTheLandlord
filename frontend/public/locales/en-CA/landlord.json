    "Balance of Reviews: If a negative review is suddenly followed by a highly positive one, take a moment to question this. It's possible for a landlord/company to have both good and bad traits, but drastic shifts in tone might indicate something is amiss.",
    "Frequency of Reviews: A sudden influx of positive reviews after a string of negative ones might be a red flag. Authentic reviews tend to come in at a steady pace over time.",
    "Consistency: Look for consistency in feedback across reviews. If several reviews mention similar pros or cons, they are likely reliable."]
