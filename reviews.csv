MADISON APARTMENT GROUPS,US,FORT COLLINS,COLORADO,80525,"Buckinghorse apartments are owned by the large parent company, Madison Apartment Group, which isn’t operated anywhere near the city. They recently acquired the rental units and have hiked prices quite steeply. They have good amenities and are permissive with their pet policy (although they do discriminate based on the reported breed of your pet). The people working on location are very good, but any administrators beyond that would be nearly impossible to reach. Overall I’m very happy with the location, I just wish they’d do more to help renters afford the place",4,3,2,5,3,2023-02-28T13:06:44.237Z,false,Profanity,true,false

I still payed out my two months noticed and was told that he would look for someone for those months. I was not allowed to advertise the place myself. He did not look and instead signed a new lease for after my two month notice, so I had to pay double rent. Overall while the house is in a really nice location not worth all the hassel. It is also extremely overpriced since all you get is a bedroom and a tiny kitchen and bathroom. Nothing is updated and while a cleaner does come in once a month everything is so old it's just permanently grungy and dirty.",2,1,1,1,3,2023-03-28T14:14:13.544Z,false,,,false

CARMELTIA DELONG,US,TEMPE,ARIZONA,85282,"Carmelita will show up whenever she pleases with less than 24 hours notice to run loud landscaping equipment and leave trash and materials in the yard. She hooks you with seemingly low rent but the house is unfinished, dirty, and (before I taped up the rotten, rusted plumbing fixtures) it was crawling with sewer roaches and crickets. I left the room cleaner and in better repair than when I moved in and she still charged me cleaning fees. She also charged me for a smoke detector. But there was never a smoke detector when I moved in. She ignored my emails about these fees. I was late on rent and she took it personally. It was incredibly unprofessional and I ended up leaving the property early on the mutual agreement that I would be out by the end of the month and she would not evict me or charge me any additional fees. I'm glad I left because it sounds like she gave the other tenants only a month to find other accommodations because she intends to sell the house. You can hear every breath and sigh and cough and fart and moan through the vents. It is not a proper space for adult housemates. The kitchen odors exhaust throughout the house too so expect your bedding and clothing to reek of cooking oil. The floors were unfinished. Her maintenence crew left ladders and construction trash and supplies in big, ugly piles all over the yard. The showers are poorly built so the water pools in a corner and leaks into the foundation. I could go on. That house needs a ton of work. I hope whoever buys it hires a competent inspector so they know what they're in for. The day I moved out, Carmelita decided I had to be out by 9am. Nowhere in the lease does it say this and the remaining tenants were fine with me finishing packing and leaving in the evening. I was waiting for the moving truck. The lease said keys must be returned at 9am, which we did. She made me leave the house without my things and coordinate with the other housemates to return in the evening, despite us already having coordinated, and despite me planning to have a couple more hours to pack. I understand late payments are troubling to landlords but it isn't personal. She made statements about my character and accused me of lying when I was extremely communicative the entire time. All of that was unnecessary and unprofessional. Carmelita doesn't think of these rooms and houses as your home. She thinks of renters as revenue streams to exploit and belittle and that's it. She constantly made emotional statements rthat made me feel unwelcome in my own home. That's completely uncalled for and quite nasty. I'm sure she'll sell this place for a lot of money and retire very well off. I hope her existing tenants found safe, clean, affordable housing with a respectful landlord. I hope she does completely retire and sells her other properties. She has no business dealing with people. Stay away from CSD2 Properties.",2,1,2,1,1,2023-03-29T22:58:56.734Z,false,,,false

EXARIS PROPERTIES,US,ST. LOUIS,MISSOURI,SOUTHCITY(BEVO),"I'm rating my property management company my landlord uses, the couple of times I've actually spoken with whoever owns my house has been reasonable. Also, they are now Exaris Properties but used to go by the name BDN Properties. The property manager for this rental is terrible. Sometimes he's on the ball with stuff and has sent maintenance out right away with no ticket, but sometimes repairs never get done no matter how many times you report it over the years. This is not just minor repairs either, I'm referring to holes in the ceiling. Often requests are just closed with no communication, and you're not always notified by email; there's a backdoor someone can use to just delete the request out of your tenant portal forcing you to submit a new one. Even with communication directly to the property manager this continues to happen

Our central heating unit has broken multiple times over the past 2 years despite working fine the first 3 years we were here. We were left with no heat in the middle of January over a weekend, after being told they could get it fixed over the weekend; also not the first time a repeated problem was promised to be repaired once and for all and maintenance simply did not show up.

I have asked them to spray for bugs outside the perimeter of the house because we've had a repeated bug problem especially in the summer since living here. They sprayed the inside once, and it didn't help, so I haven't asked them to do the inside again. The requests have been ignored and closed with no acknowledgement. I've taken the issue into my own hands and put glue traps around the problem areas, and spray the outside with raid

I have had maintenance enter the house after knocking, and almost walked in on someone showering. I tried to discuss this situation to make sure this didn't happen again. He said ""The tech was in the area and wanted to pop in to get it done"" No guarantee was given that this wouldn't happen in the future, and I'm not even sure that is legal

The one thing I can give them praise on is the rent/fees (or lack of). I pay a reasonable rent for the size of my house, and haven't had an increase in 5 years. Never had a surprise fee or anything like that",1,1,5,2,1,2023-03-29T23:29:23.950Z,false,,,false
BROOKSIDE APARTMENTS/C&R REAL ESTATE ,US,MILWAUKE,OREGON,JOHNSONCREEK,"This property management company tried to charge us for normal wear and tear. Luckily, Oregon law prevents this and a quick court filing negated their fraudulent claim.

Manager would stand outside your apartment to stare at your microscopic deck and windows for perceived violations of aesthetics (i.e. Halloween decorations up, a pirate flag, soil from planting the previous weekend, plant pots that weren't mounted, etc.) 

Although assigned parking, people would park in our spot all the time and managers never helped us.

Geese live by the creek and fly on the roof to honk and nest. 

They keep tearing down trees by the creek, allowing more noise from the factory and traffic across the water. 

The manager tells you it's cool to smoke by the creek or off the property but several neighbors received a fine when spotted. 

24hr entry notices for maintenance really meant ""sometime this month"". Once, a Verizon tech was in the apartment unexpectedly, without a mask during the pandemic. When I asked him to leave because I didn't receive proper notice, nor did I request service, I was threatened with eviction.

Then the owners thought they should install new windows and siding without giving clear information about the procedure and what to expect. Workers played loud music and left supplies and equipment in common areas where people walk and get into their cars. New siding is ugly; we enjoyed the ochre color but now it's boring gray.

Overall, the experience was terrible and when they raised the rent 9.75% (just below the 9.9% limit that requires landlords to pay for relocation costs), we were out of there. We never once missed rent during the pandemic, as we have essential jobs.

Repairs on the upstairs unit took months, were incredibly loud and disruptive late into the night, and resulted in burst pipes on at least three occasions, which destroyed property and rained mouse droppings and mold into the kitchen and two bedrooms. This was at least partially due to their refusal to hire an actual plumber to do the plumbing. They do not provide notice before showing up to give tours.

When you inquire about the room, she will tell you there are no rules, that you can leave any time no strings attached, that she is very open and approachable and she will try to help you adapt to Canada. The longer you stay there, you will start to realize that she will impose more and more rules and restrictions leaving you no choice but to leave. When you try to leave, that's when she will tell you that the agreement is for one year and that you have to pay for her losses up to 1 year rent. This landlord rents our rooms to students new to Canada and she specifically targets these people to take advantage of them. I was a victim of this and I would absolutely recommend anyone to avoid this place if you had any other choice. If this is your only option, please please make sure you ask for an agreement detailing the terms of the rent, make sure she will provide you with a lock and key to your room and make sure you understand all the rules before giving her your money.

Some things that I have experienced during my time there....

She invades my privacy by entering my room when I'm at school during the day, she does not allow me to use the kitchen to cook (after cancelling the meal plan with her), she does not provide the proper heating or cooling to my room (I literally need to walk around with a blanket or have my jacket on in the winter time or have a fan blowing on blocks of ice in the summer). She did not provide proper lighting to the room and does not even allow the light fixtures to have all the light bulbs installed. When I informed her that I will be ending the tenancy next month, she immediately kicked me out without any proper notice, literally sent a WeChat message and excepted me to leave within 1 week. She did not return any deposit or let me use my deposit towards a last months rent. She constantly harassed me and emotionally abused me via WeChat voice messages until I moved my belongings.

Landlord gave six months notice for an upcoming rent increase, but is planning to increase the rent mid-fixed term agreement (new contract to be signed in mid 2022, rent increase is to take place end of year 2022, halfway through a new fixed term agreement), and also no circumstances other than greed caused the rent increase. Landlord purposefully misrepresented some information on the lease agreement regarding amount of pets present, and refuses to correct it to the correct amount of pets for unknown reasons. If when I move out they return the damage deposit (no damage caused) I would place them above average, if they don't I would say below average. Landlord does inform residents of workers coming to residence, however very rarely is it more than a couple of hours of notice at best.

The floors, walls, and bathrooms were if similar disrepair. Jim was a negligent and cowardly man who dodged every attempt to contact him about anything, until the owners remembered the property existed during the post-COVID housing price upswing, at which point every contact was an attempt to kick us out early so they could gut and paint the place, and put it back on the market for 2.5x the rent price.

MICHELLE CUNNINGHAM (FORT LOWELL REALTY),US,TUCSON,ARIZONA,85719,"1) Repair. My AC outlet didn't work and the hot water heater broke within a week of me being there. I submitted so many tickets and called so many times over my entire lease, and they only ever decided to send maintenance on the last week of my tenancy. I had to go to my friend's house to take a shower for months. 

2) Health/Safety. Like the majority of apartment complexes, we had roaches. It's just that management never bothered trying to control the situation, despite informing them about it.

3) Rent stability. I will say that for the time, $400 wasn't awful for a studio. And I never saw the price increase until the pandemic hit. But I was still paying $400 a month to live in a dangerous roach infested hellhole with no hot water.

4) Tenant Privacy. The management office would constantly call me at work and ask me if I still lived there for some reason. And I found some of my things moved around one day when I came back. 

5) Respect rating. I give this a '1' because I was overcharged for rent once and sent Michelle a text asking her to refund the amount I overpaid. Instead of saying ""No problem, let's get you that refund"" she berated me and even said, and I quote, ""That's not a very nice thing to say to your landlord first thing in the morning."" I wasn't being rude, I was just letting her know. Through a text message. The least annoying way to get in touch with somebody.  Anyway, I have to wonder if me inconveniencing her was the reason why she never sent maintenance.

We were without a washing machine for a month, without a dishwasher for a month, and unable to access our garage for a month- and received no credit to reflect the inconvenience of being without an amenity for which we overpay. The maintenance staff does try, but they're overextended and frankly many of them are not competent to perform the needed repairs. The office staff is incompetent and Sunny in particular is rude to actively hostile. Rent goes up every year despite there being no improvements to the property. Crime has increased in the area, and there is a lot of theft of packages or from cars. We pay for security that is never present, and were charged for a package room that is not used (Management angrily insists it's every single delivery service's fault, which seems unlikely). There is a lot of noise and management does nothing to handle tenants breaking noise rules (Difficult when you need to sleep for work) or harassing others.

NATHAN CHANG CLAREVIEW PARK ESTATES,CA,EDMONTON,Alberta,T5Y0Z6,"I rented here for 5 years. When we looked at the place, the property managers were a couple. Of skids. They wanted the damage deposit in cash. Owner told me months later that this couple stole the money. There was supposed to be a washer/dryer in unit, property managers sold it and took the money. I had to buy my own washer and dryer. Was never given a walk through or given a least to sign. Owner Nathan Chan fires that couple and replace with another who last only a few months. Nathan fired them and hired an old lady who was pleasant until you meet her alcoholic son, who wasn't listed on anything legally regarding authority but took it upon himself to take over for his mother. He would attempt to fix things that he wasn't qualified to fix. We had an issue with our electrical box and they sent a first year apprentice from another building who owed money to fix it. The guy told me straight out that he wasn't qualified for this repair but they offered to take money off the rent he owed to fix it. It never got fixed. Dwayne is the alcoholic son. I was a single mom who he enjoyed tormenting. He would come give entry notices for less than 24 hours and when you argued with him it wasn't legal, he would throw a fit. Very scary. He loved to intimidate people, or try to. I'd stand up to him. In the last year alone that we were there, I got 147 entry notices about the furnace that not once got fixed. There was so many that I kept them all. There was a work order by the city to fix the furnace that never happened. We lived on the 3rd floor and when it was windy, the patio doors would blow inward when closed. They never cleaned the fireplaces. 

Dwayne was working with another drunk on the furnace in the hallway. They were working on that thing all the time, most of every week for 2 months. They never did fix it which caused a fire. My son noticed smoke in the hallway, called 911, got the cats in the crate and went outside and called me at work from one of the firefighters cell phones. This was 2 weeks before Christmas. The Red Cross provided us with accommodations for 3 days, then we were on our own. The fire was in the hallway from that furnace they were trying to fix. The ceiling in our hallway was gutted and we couldn't get back in for 3 weeks. We spent Christmas in a hotel. We were told that there would be a discount on January rent but when it came time to pay, they gaslight me and the other tenants. I ended up moving due to safety issues. The places should be torn down. Never got my $1200.00 damage deposit since owner, Nathan Chang said it got stolen by his property managers. 

When something needed to be repaired, he would hire illegal Chinese workers. They would come by mini van for 2 weeks a year and get dropped off, then picked up again at night. There are so many city of Edmonton work orders on the place. Read for yourself: https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/phab/phab-09-2018-decision.pdf

Thinking about it now, we should have stayed and fought back but we ended up finding an amazing place and ended up buying it a couple of years down the line. His wife and him were also quite nosey, only allowed laundry once a week during a 2 hour window. He also expected us to professionally clean the entire unit before moving out, randomly adding that into an existing contract.

GP MANAGEMENT,US,LAKE VILLA,ILLINOIS,60046,"Polite and friendly staff, however it is incredibly obvious that GP Management will do whatever they can to cut costs. Maintenance has had to revisit my unit no fewer than 3 times per issue I’ve submitted because they always start with the cheapest “fix”. For example, my tub was leaking into the wall of the unit below, they came and added about 3 feet of caulk in the area where it was leaking. Didn’t even remove the old existing caulk, just slapped more on top. Had to call them back two more times to actually stop the leak and then replace the caulk around the whole tub. Don’t get me started on the dishwasher and AC unit. They also keep increasing rent every time I renew my lease, but the actual value of the property never changes. The money they’re making isn’t going into improving the value of the property, it’s lining the owners pockets. Over all, it could be worse, but it could also be much much better.

DAVID VISCO,US,BOSTON ,MASSACHUSETTS,02135,"- when a skunk moved in under our porch, which blocked our only exit to the driveway, David told us it was not his problem; we would have to call animal control.
- David frequently surveyed the property without notice and entered the property several times without notice. 
- David often parked perpendicular across the end of the driveway and blocked us in
- when an absolute nightmare of a person moved in downstairs after 5 years of us never complaining about any of the above listed items, David did nothing to stop them from playing loud music constantly, smoking indoors (which we could smell all through our apartment), screaming and fighting with one another (we called the cops at least twice on them); they had an aggressive German shepherd that would jump over the fence into our neighbor’s yards or lunge at people walking by on the sidewalk, and they never cleaned up his poop. Also would not allow me to break my lease and move out when I told him it was making it impossible to teach remotely (this was during the pandemic when schools shut down, I am a teacher.)
- David owns at least 4 properties in Brighton (Boston) and two of them were also occupied by my coworkers, one of whom is a gay man, who lived with two other gay men. David was MUCH more invasive and strict to him & his roommates compared to me or my other hetero coworker that he was also renting to. I saw the communication between them myself and he was much more brusque and intolerant of things that he never commented on to me & my roommate, like the cleanliness and location of our trash bins. He also harassed them about anything that remained visible on their front porch, meanwhile he let my horrid downstairs neighbors leave an entire (destroyed) sectional couch, dog crate, and literal garbage pile up on our front porch for months and David never did or said anything about it. They also caught him attempting to enter the property unannounced multiple times (which probably means he was doing it other times and wasn’t caught.)

They also didn't raise our rent for 2023, so we've had the same rent since 2021. Overall, great landlord.",4,5,5,5,5,2023-04-17T23:09:07.483Z,false,,,false

DEVON PROPERTIES,CA,PARKSVILLE,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V9P1N5,"Oh goodness where to even start with these jokers. I moved into a brand new building, about a month after it opened. 

TLDR: Devon properties is full of thieves planning on turning our community into a slum city.

I had called and arranged a date and time to move in, to have one of the elevators put on hold. They never did this, didn’t put any padding up (like they did for other tenants), and claimed they had no idea I was moving in, despite showing them the email chain that they had been replying to. 

The apartment was unfinished. Paint was not done and there was damage all over the apartment, dings on walls, damaged drywall, scuffed paint, damaged tub, damaged microwave, and the floor was peeling up (remember this is a BRAND NEW building). The building manager promised the work would be done and the issues corrected. I never saw any repairs done, even after a year of being there and multiple calls/emails/visits. Every time I brought it up I was promised the work would be done soon. Lies, lies, lies. The work was never done when I moved out, and the mdf trim that was in the washroom that was never sealed or painted was already starting to warp.

The heat pump stopped working correctly and they said it would be 5 months to get a repairman in to look at it (so I just fixed it myself). 

The washer and dryer stopped working and after weeks of waiting, they told me it would be a couple weeks for the tech to come take a look at it, they never did come. 

Each unit had a storage locker that was supposed to be on the same floor as the apartment (this was in the lease), it took me 5 months before I got the storage locker and mine was down in the basement. They left the keys in the storage lockers and just let people have a free for all until they got things relatively sorted out after another month of bs. 

There were no lightbulbs in the fixtures when I moved in, and this was marked on my inspection. They still tried to charge me for no lightbulbs when I moved out.

They sent a maintenance guy to the apartment with no notice to fix the kitchen sinks, there was no overflow drainage in them. The guy looked like a bum off the street and showed up while I was at work. He tried to force his way into the apartment while my girlfriend was there alone, and scared her with how aggressive he was being. He literally tried to shove his way into the apartment.

They went through 4 building managers during the year that I was there. They mistreated, overworked, and underpaid all of them. So they kept quitting.

The website they used for paying rent was constantly down. It didn’t work, it would crash all the time, and wouldn’t process payments reliably, and often took several days to do so. As a result I got hit with many late fees and ended up getting cheques to pay with.

When I moved out, they tried to claim that I didn’t pay my last months rent (I did). I showed them the carbon copy of the cheque, the cheque image, and a screenshot of the money coming out of my account. They refused to acknowledge any of this and still sent the balance to collections.",1,2,1,1,1,2023-04-12T20:17:52.868Z,false,,,false

ANDREW JAMES,CA,OSHAWA,ONTARIO,L1G3Z7,"I rented 63 McMillian Drive from Andrew James for 7 weeks at the beginning of 2023. The reason why it was only seven weeks and not the entire year long lease was the illegal eviction that Andrew James levied against me with an N5 and N7 forms, for entirely false reasons. Opting not to fight these, I left the unit and was reimbursed the final week's rent in February. However this left me homeless and I had to move back in with my parents, a very sub-optimal situation. I will note, I did NO damage to the rental unit, he was making up reasons to evict me because I wasn't going to leave willingly. 

Andrew James conducted an illegal unit inspection while conducting an outlet repair on a GFI outlet that had shocked me. Andrew James had an illegal renovation done on his property to install a second entry/exit to the second floor of the house; then had the call to call that access an 'emergency exit only' and insisted he didn't need to maintain it. Andrew James failed to keep the property at the legal temperature during winter multiple times, resulting in my having to call the City of Oshawa to correct him of his mistakes. Andrew James also let the foundation of this rental house deteriorate to the point of near collapse in one location, causing severe concerns about the safety of the entire 3 unit structure in question. 

Without a doubt, Andrew James is a slumlord. He works as a mobile mortgage specialist for TD Canada Trust, and at the time, was using bank resources to run his rentals business on the side (company phone + email + e-signing portal). 

My experience with Andrew James was a 0/10 and I recommend nobody ever rent from him, no matter how good a deal he may seem to be offering. Your complaints will be met with offers to make you homeless, and he will not perform repairs in a timely or proper manner. ",1,1,1,1,1,2023-04-12T21:12:10.245Z,false,,,false

They were not respectful of privacy as when we decided to rent the place, we had to send out an application to the tenant living there at the time because they don't like using the internet. Due to them being unfamiliar with email, we were not able to have written or digital records of any issues. A constant issue in the building was that our unit and building were infested with ants. Our unit was exterminated five times in a year and the ands continued to return. Ultimately, what has led me to leave this review and rating is that once we decided to move out from the unit after a year was their inflexibility with rental prices (the unit and building were old and they were charging more rent than other units in the building and were not willing to consider a lower price). Once we ended our lease, they began bullying us and became belligerent. We cleaned our unit impeccably, but they wanted to charge our damage deposit for leaving one nail hole in the wall and not dusting the inside of the closet DOOR before we moved out. They yelled and screamed at us and blamed previous damage that was noted in our original damage report on us. It became a Jekyll and Hyde situation with them. I do not recommend renting from them!

Their staff are poorly treated and overworked, always running around putting out fires, I always feel bad asking for help. They will arbitrarily increase rent, by over 15% in a given year. The worst part by far is how they scam you with a rental model based on ‘incentives.’ Likely your rent will be set at a ridiculous level well above fair market rent, and then they offer several hundreds of dollars in ‘incentives’ to bring the rent down to a reasonable level. They do this for two reasons, one so they can increase your rent by any amount they want to in any year, because of course you already legally agreed to pay 30% more than what you’re paying, we just happened to remove 30% of incentives. Second they do this as a cover for their investors, their balance sheet is artificially inflated by showing higher income and expenses, making them seem more valuable on paper.

In the electrical outlets. They got code violations. The washers actually made your clothes dirty. There was a leak and water was coming out of the walls. Then there was mold inside the walls. There was a fire on the 25th floor and our alarms didn't go off. Since they never clean the dryer vents, it's only a matter of time before there's a fire.

ELLIOTT ST APARTMENTS,CA,KINGSTON,ONTARIO,K7K6J9,"Never have I had a landlord make so many demands to enter everyone's apartments before. At least 4-5 times per year they are going through everyone's place which is incredibly intrusive and annoying. 

They are constantly raising the price of the laundry machines even though if you fill up the washer you're going to need to run the dryer AT LEAST twice. Awfully convenient to raise laundry prices while your dryer is barely warmer than room temp. 

They raise the rent literally every chance they can. Since moving out my current landlord has not raised rent one time despite my place being wayyyy below market rate already. 

The stove they provide is from the 70s or something. You know that gross yellow/beige coil element stove your grandma had? Yeah you still use that if you live with these guys. 

My apartment had no less than 5 different types of flooring. Basically made it look like I was living in a building made of glued together popsicle sticks. 

They added numbered parking spots which was nice at first but then people kept taking my spot as it just happened to be a desirable one and the LL did absolutely nothing, basically expected me to just suck it up.

SKYLINE LIVING,CA,KINGSTON,ONTARIO,K7M5X1,"After moving in to a unit it became how apparent both the previous tenant and the staff care about cleanliness: Dead bugs on window sills, lots and LOTS of hairs in the bathroom, mysterious gunk on some surfaces in the kitchen. 
Some maintenance issues from day 1 as well, which they took several weeks to respond to - all things they should have looked at during the moving out of the previous tenant IE cabinets coming off at the hinges. 
Besides the above I have had no issues major issues besides cigarette smell in the halls at any given time despite a no smoking indoors policy - living there has been smooth for the most part following the gut-wrenching cleaning I had to do on the first day of living there. There is the occasional night of loud music or partying; the few times this has been unfairly disruptive IE 1am on a Tuesday the landlord is quick to respond and ask the other person to quiet down which I do like. 
It’s not necessarily a problem but I would like to note on here that the building staff find some reason or another to enter your unit typically once every couple of months; they do this after providing written notice and it’s usually just to flush the toilet during the day. 
They are a good landlord overall, if you are anal about good hygiene and having things in good repair then I would avoid. Skyline staff if you are reading this - I mean no disrespect, I know some of you work hard to maintain the building and grounds, but people need to be warned in case they expect something cleaner/nicer given the high cost of rent.

Pros:
- Dedicated weekly garbage removal 
- Excellent response rates to environmental problems like plumbing, AC
- Maintains appliances at optimal condition
- Offers full kitchen, two bathrooms and an on-site washing machine and dryer (washing machine/ dryer accessible after 7PM or weekends)
- Speaks English / Vietnamese

Cons:
- Will make tenants responsible for other tenants living in the space (Example: Tenant leaves for vacation and fails to clean their food out of the fridge, will make the remaining tenants clean it)
- No pets allowed, will lead to eviction of animal
- Brings strangers down or enter the unlocked basement area with little to no warning
- No rent relief during Covid
- Dismisses tenant concerns in regards to other tenants
- Fire alarm always goes off whenever using oven

MINESH PATEL,US,LOMBARD,ILLINOIS,60148,"Minesh Patel is a wonderfully kind and understanding landlord. He will go out his way to assist you and provides pure professionalism in his manners.

However, the two apartment buildings that he owns and manages himself in Lombard are absolutely atrocious. He is quick to order and get help for any issues relating to the individual units, but the buildings themselves need lots of work and better upkeep. 

He also seems to let absolutely anyone rent out the units. There are tenants that live there who are extremely disrespectful, rude, and just plainly do not care about the welfare of their living conditions and environment. It’s very aggravating and annoying when you have neighbors who are so careless. 

I wish he was more concerned and better enforced with his policies and regulations on just pure basic upkeep and maintenance of simple tasks and requirements. These buildings could be looking and doing so much better but they are piss poor as of now.

She also disregarded me as a ""tenant"" and everytime I would come back past the time she would allow me to be outside (keep in mind I'm a uni student she can't tell me when to come back as an international student lol) she would tell me that I'm being disruptive to the other tenants and that they pay monthly and I would drive them away if I was to continue being noisy, multiple times I had to remind her that I am also a tenant which she always nodded off. She would pressure me daily to do some weird house chores and would spam my email (as she had no phone) with a very hyper-aggressive tone and when I'd come back from a long day of university or work she'd sit me down and have a unnecessary talk with me about what we discussed in the email. I was very new to the area and to canada and when I came with my problems with her she didn't like that as she thought ""there is no problem"" and opened the door and told me to leave the house right this moment and take my stuff.

This 'guy' is Davide Weiss, king of the Etobicoke NHL worthy backyard rink.  Let's buildings fall apart, can't keep staff (because he treats them so badly), doesn't vet staff (new superintendent was picked up by police after 6 weeks with 5 outstanding warrants...for serious crimes).  Doesn't hold property manager accountable for vetting tenants.  Two buildings are overrun with the 3 horseman of pests:  roaches, bedbugs AND mice.  Treatments are not performed to eradicate but to satisfy Toronto By-Law and yes, this landlord has a file with the city.  Must upgrade electrical, fire plans NOT up to property standards and yet Toronto's own RentSafeTO gave all the buildings a pass.  (That's a failure on the city's part).  Probably the only landlord with empty units because he wants top dollar but units are in such poor condition, they aren't worth it.  Currently, 1 super is a bully trying to evice paying tenants so he can re-rent higher and the other super is nosy, always looking over your head when you answer the door.  Landlord does not care for tenants, just wants their rent.  He will say or do anything to placate tenants.  The only thing he understands is a By-Law mandate from the city and fines for non-compliance.  And even that has a tough time getting through his head.  Avoid at all costs.

SPYRA TAYLOR COPE,CA,VANCOUVER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V5W1T2,"Do not rent from this person. Seems nice at first. Expected me to sign an illegal vacate clause on the rental agreement. Doesn't respond to maintenance queries in a timely manner.
I asked if she could call me because I needed to break the lease early and wanted to discuss options. Like, DISCUSS it, like adults. She didn’t respond and instead got her lawyer husband (who practices an entirely unrelated area of law) to send me a letter on legal letterhead which was threatening in tone and didn’t align with my rights under the BC Residential Tenancy Act. He threatened major expenses for me after I responded with a polite query pointing to a relevant section of the RTA. 
When I did move out, I left the place spotless. Every prior landlord had been beyond pleased with the condition I left their units, and this was up to the same standard. They sent two women I’d never seen before who had clearly been instructed to inform me the place wasn’t clean enough, no matter what. They also had no idea what a Condition Inspection Report is, a standard form used in property rentals. When I refused to be extorted for professional cleaning fees on a spotless apartment, the owner went to the Residential Tenancy Branch claiming I’d done $4000 worth of damage – completely fabricated. They included pictures that weren’t even in my unit (hey, my apartment didn’t have textured walls – nor am I responsible for ceiling stains from moisture seepage from the roof). And get this, they FORGED a carpet cleaning receipt to submit as “evidence” – I had shampooed the carpet myself with a steam cleaner. They altered a carpet cleaning receipt from the unit next to mine and I was able to confirm this with the carpet cleaning company that it wasn’t for my unit.
What they didn’t know was that I had taken many, many pictures of every part of the apartment after I’d cleaned it, to prove I hadn’t left it dirty. 
They lost their hearing due to multiple factors and total incompetence on their part, and then tried to escalate legally. Nothing came of it, but these people are really not worth the grief to rent from – stay far, far, away. I think they mostly rent to foreign exchange students who don’t understand their rights in BC and are therefor easily taken advantage of.

DAVID HO,CA,VANCOUVER ,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V5R4T1,"Moved into the unit with roommates October 2020, rent was $3000/m for tio 2 floor of a 4bdrm house. There were 4 of us, as it was advertised as a 4 bdrm house. Things were fine for about a year and a half, until the landlord suddenly sent us a letter saying they had ""recently noticed"" that there were 4 of us living in the house that were non-related or common law, that this violated their home insurance policy, and that the 4th tenant had to move out immediately. Otherwise they threatened eviction. We filed a dispute with the RTB on the grounds that we had been upfront from the beginning that there were 4 of us, and that if it violated their insurance, the onus was on them to know that, not us as tenants. By the time our hearing came around, the 4th person has left anyway, and we didn't want to stay. RTB brokered an agreement where the landlord agreed to let us stay ""up to January 31, 2022"" while we looked for a place. We started looking right away, had a lot of trouble finding a place. Finally found some decent prospects, but landlords told us, no, the RTB said you had to stay until January 31. This was incorrect, as the wording was ""up to"", but we had to file for official clarification. RTB sided with us, we moved out December 31. Upon move out, landlords tried to ding us on literally everything, including saying we were responsible for hiring a professional cleaning company and a power washing company for the patio. A few weeks after moving out, they sent us a quote from a ""construction company"" billing us $2300 in repairs, in addition to keeping our deposit of $1500. Construction company was just one of their Chinese friends, and we did not pay, despite them ""graciously"" offering to waive $400 for cleaning company fee if we paid before January 15. They are now trying to take us to rental court over this ridiculously inflated repair fee, which is very obviously them just  trying to get us to pay for their home renovations. We counter-claimed, stating that by law, they had until the 15th to either return our deposit or file an RTB dispute. They did not file until the 22nd. More recently, they made an addendum to their claim, saying that in addition to the $3800 they are already trying to claim, that we owe them a further $3100 for ""missing rent"" for January. This is despite us moving out in December, us giving proper notice, the RTB confirming we were not obligated to stay until January 31 as long as we provided 1 month notice, AND them having a new tenant move in January 1st. DO NOT rent from them, or they will scam you, threaten and intimidate you, and come after you. Oh, and did I forget to mention the house had a mice infestation? Steer clear.

2. When the other tenants moved out, the LL requested we move within the next month to their vacated unit, and implied we would be forced to move because it was family moving in. We requested proper forms and suddenly the LLs family no longer was going to move in.
3. Showed up unannounced to do repairs, and would only stop when directly confronted.
4. Used language barrier as a means of weaponized incompetence - claimed to be unaware of BC LL website & forms, LL rights & responsibilities (etc.)

STONEWALL PROPERTY GROUP,US,SAN ANTONIO,TEXAS,78249,"This property management group manages several properties in San Antonio. I lived in the Jackson Flats, at 615 Vance-Jackson. They tout the units as ""fully renovated"" and use an actually renovated unit to show the potential renter, stating the actual apartment for rent is not ready to show. That seems to be true, but based on the condition of the unit I moved in to they skipped the finishing part. To begin, the kitchen cabinet doors were not even hung on the cabinets. They had been re-painted & lined up against the wall in the dining room, making it difficult to load in my moving boxes so that the doors would be accessible for someone to come in and hang them (which took over a week after move-in). There were many other unfinished issues: No light fixture in the bedroom, just an uncovered bulb in the ceiling; no pull cord in closet for the light; badly sloping foundation; laminate floor tiles buckled & creating trip hazard. They neglected to tell me they have NO maintenance staff. Repairs take days to even get a first response & often weeks to complete because the contractors they use only want to work at night. As a single female, I found this unacceptable. They refused to give me a key to the mailbox, stating it was MY responsibility to go to the post office & request one then pay to have my copy provided. According to the post office that was not true, and it took weeks for me to finally get a key from Stonewall. I am not one to leave poor reviews out of spite. I pay my rent on time, in full.

FRED AND MAY ALICE BUGNO,US,PITTSBURGH,PENNSYLVANIA,15202,"I rarely hear from my landlords, which is fine. They are mostly respectful and mostly leave me alone. Repairs are not done in a timely manner. Some are left to me (a single mom) and reimbursed for materials, others go to the lowest bidder, or the landlord does them himself when the weather is nice enough. I have rented 5 years without any breach of contract but the landlord will still charge $50 if I am a day or two late, which has happened 3 times or fewer in the last 5 years. I am concerned about the safety of my front porch steps for the mail carrier, my back porch steps which are crumbling, and potential mold in my basement, which is never dry. My utility bills almost match my rent due to poor insulation, window seals, drafts, etc. and having to run a large dehumidifier in my basement year-round to keep the mold away. In the summer, I sleep outside because my apartment is too hot to sleep in and the electrical system will only support 1 A/C unit (so that goes to my daughter’s room). Overall, my landlord is mostly kind and I think he thinks he’s compassionate, but not always available when I need him or understanding of the life and responsibilities of a single parent. His wife (my other landlord) kept key facts from me when I viewed the apartment, and only let me know afterward (like for example, that the bathtub will flood the dining room any time I try to bathe my then 8 year old, due to no overflow support/drainage). Occasionally, the landlord will show up at my apartment without calling, and just knock on the door until I make myself available (I work from home now).

FPI MANAGEMENT,US,SEATTLE,WASHINGTON,98101,"Took over our building in downtown Seattle back in 2021, and the whole place has gone drastically downhill. Technically this building is supposed to have a ""community room"", a sauna, and a pool. They closed and locked all three of those to save money. 

They shut down the trash chutes and brought in a ""valet living"" trash service that we're forced to pay $35 a month for, even though we had a perfectly working trash chute on every floor. I live literally 10 feet from the trash chute and instead i'm only allowed to take out my trash once a day between 5:30 and 7:30 pm, AND the valet trash people are required to take photos of my trash can so if I don't place my trash out ""properly"" they can charge me an extra $25 per offense. The trash rules they make you follow are ridiculous, the trash can is tiny, so if you have to throw two bags of trash out, i have to stack one on top of the can, which can fall over, thus touching the ground, which will cost me more. 

They raise the rent as much as they legally can every year in Seattle (10%) and raised the parking costs 25% to $250/mo. They're consistently messing with the hot water pressure, so I've had to take military-style showers or schedule showers at non-peak times... not always a possibility.

This building has two perfectly working elevators, but they've decided to shut one down to use their newfound rent money from us to replace them, so they're shutting one down for 30 WEEKS, then the other one, for a total of 60 WEEKS. people moving in or out can't reserve the one working elevator, which the valet trash people use to haul trash manually down to the dumpster in the basement every night. In short, the management obviously treats us like nothing more than a commodity, The hallways are filled with trash every night, we have one working elevator for a 25 floor building, the entrance door is broken apparently, and they've taken away any sense of community.

PRIVATE EQUITY SOLUTIONS (PES),US,ORLANDO,FLORIDA,32804,"For the price they charge, they’re really quite bad. The company is clearly not capable of being landlords. They are primarily an investment holding company and it shows. Some examples: accusing us of lying about insect infestations, then telling us pest control is our responsibility, and, upon our pointing out that the lease literally says pest control is landlord’s responsibility, offering an unlicensed guy they found on craigslist to come inside and treat said infestation with chemicals (sounds a bit sketchy to let some random guy with no license as required by law to spray areas your pets have access to);  allowing leaks in the wall to go untreated for so long that the floor has to be ripped up to treat mold; fire alarm going off all night—it cannot be shut off without the landlord’s consent—and the landlord would not answer their phone until the next day; gate hasn’t worked properly for six months; broken appliances take a year to fix (had to say we would not renew at the increased price without fixing appliance); landlord rarely even acknowledges that you contacted them, and when they do aw knowledge, they do not fix the issue; did not have lawn services for 3-5 months and the yard was completely overgrown… The list goes on.

TRICON,US,HOUSTON,TEXAS,77375,"Very fast to make repairs. Main complaint comes in terms of rapidly increasing the price of rent, above market conditions. They made it nearly impossible to reach anyone to negotiate these increases. As well as persistently assessing fees that are impossible to sort out. They changed the company that was handling their renter's insurance 4 times in 2-3 years, and each time they started wrongly charging insurance fees. They made it the renter's responsibility to deal with all these other companies and register over and over again, and try to get refunds. They never gave notice, despite their claims to the contrary. In the end they charged me hundreds of dollars I never owed. Terrible. I'm convinced this is a methodical, purposeful over-charging of tenants.",3,5,2,5,3,2023-04-18T18:26:45.962Z,false,,,false

Tore up the front concrete to be in compliance with the City, then threw down grass seed, which was patchy, never mowed, and caught all types of floating litter. Never cleaned up, and apartment front looked super trashy after that and by far the worst on the otherwise-cute old block of row houses.

FIRSTKEY HOMES,US,HOUSTON,TEXAS,77088,"Avoid!! This company continually added huge fees that they admitted were incorrect, but amounted to hundreds of dollars. Worse, they would try to force us to pay them even as they admitted they were wrong, promising repayment later. We refused. At one point they threatened to evict us for refusing to pay several hundred dollars in fees that they admitted in writing we didn't even owe. We said we would be happy to let a judge see what they were doing and get a housing attorney, and they relented. They kept trying to make excuses to inspect the house without an appointment, which is against Texas law. They also doubled the rent on the house inside of 4 years, way out of line with market conditions. Their behavior was so horrible we decided to cash in our retirement funds and buy a house. The house is in disrepair. It took them over two weeks to replace the dishwasher, and the sewer pipe was collapsing in the backyard. They refused to pay for plumbing repairs even though the issue was obviously caused by the collapsing pipe. The backyard is full of sinkholes emitting sewer gas. They also tried to require us to pay for repairs to the house not related to wear and tear. The house was given to us in filthy condition but they are insisting we have to return it in pristine condition or face fees of more than $400/room.

"EGLANTINA ""EGLA"" AZISLLARI",CA,DARTMOUTH,NOVA SCOTIA,B3J1S7,"As far as I know, there is only one building that Eglantina ""Egla"" Azisllari owns, which is located in Dartmouth. Egla is a paternalistic parasite of the lowest order, eagerly taking advantage of the young and uneducated, the elderly, disabled, the downtrodden, and uninformed newcomers alike. When informed that our thermostat did not work (during the winter) she did nothing. When informed that the bar of our oven door had fallen off, her first move was to take the oven door bar for SIX MONTHS before her husband finally returned... to haphazardly glue it on (it fell off again two days later). An even unluckier tenant, a very young man with no family in the province, was forced to sleep in a glorified storage room during the coldest months of the year when she refused to fix his broken window in a timely manner.

Egla also possesses an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the rental system in Nova Scotia, as well, having used an out-of-date standard lease form for years. When she attempted to evict me unlawfully and was subsequently brought before the Tenancy Board for a hearing, she changed her story in the middle of the hearing to try and push me out of my unit, going as far as to say that she needed me out, no matter what. (She was not successful.)

Tenants changed out every few months, as she began using fixed-term leases for every unit so she could raise the rent indiscriminately between tenants. Only two tenants had lived in her building for longer than one year at the time I moved: myself, and my upstairs neighbor, who had been living there before Egla bought the building.",1,3,1,1,1,2023-04-18T19:02:32.249Z,false,,,false

COMPTEN MANAGEMENT,CA,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M3C1W7,"Compten Management bought our properties - 2, 4, 6 The Donway East as well as 1053 Don Mills Rd in 2017 - They got them as a ""Buy and Hold"" investment - and began their tenure
They did awful, crappy, unnecessary and cosmetic upgrades to the buildings - which caused MAJOR problems, Human Rights Violations as well as inconveniences to the tenants.  They refused to provide ANY proper accommodations despite requests and the tenants going to the City of Toronto, our City Councillor, MPP, MP as well as the media.  They then Filed and were awarded a 3.2% AGI (Above Guideline Rental Increase) and afterwards they filed an Application to Demolish the properties into Condos with the City of Toronto.  WHY should tenants PAY for upgrades in a building that will be destroyed? Why would a Management Company even invest money into a building they were going to destroy in 5 years or less? Especially when these Improvements were NOT necessary, not required, were cosmestic or deferred maintenance ?   This is a financialized Landlord seeking to displace tenants and re-develop older buildings into Condo's.  
While they have done these so called ""Upgrades"" - Compten Management has cut back on basic maintenance issues - cleaning and garbage - which has resulted into on-going fly, cockroach, and other pest infestations. Tenants have made multiple complaints over the last 4 years to the City and we still have NOT gotten the situation fully resolved.  They refuse to deal with ANY Human Rights Accommodation Requests - even when tenants have had letters written from Legal Aid Offices or CERA/CCHR.  This Landlord simply will not comply with basic Residential Tenancies Act or City By Laws - They are owned by Jack Greenberg a Lawyer who uses his position to threaten, coerce and harass tenants with potential litigation if they do not comply with the Management Company's requests.

COMMON BOND PROPERTIES,US,ANNANDALE,MINNESOTA,55302,"I have been renting from this company for several years. They get worse & worse as the years pass. Sadly, I do love where I live but the property management company is terrible! Whenever a resident raises an issue related to health & safety, we are told ""it is not reasonable to be asked to hold other tenants accountable"" for things like smoking indoors (in a non-smoking building) or leaving trash & food around the property, causing unsanitary conditions & pests.

A once lovely, cozy apartment building is now a run-down, rodent & insect-infested eyesore. It's become an embarrassment to admit to anyone you live here. Everyone in town knows this building to be where drugs, mental illness & poor people live. This has very little to do with the actual residents & everything to do with the apathy directed toward improving the situation for a bunch of subsidized, disabled, old people. Common Bond should be absolutely ashamed that this is how they ""professionally"" manage properties.

Common Bond is a ""non-profit"" in which the Board members give themselves pay raises, appoint themselves to important positions, and collect funding from taxpayers, while they all drive around in their $100k cars. Fun fact:  employees are often heard complaining about their jobs & lives to the poorest 1% of the population.

MARY ELLEN PENICOOK,US,LA GRANGE,ILLINOIS,60525,"During our tenancy, our lower-level rental apartment flooded around half a dozen times due to rain. We always notified the landlord about this. She insisted on sending someone around to clear the gutters. The floods kept getting worse every time, so it was clear that the gutters weren’t the problem: the insulation on the side of the building was inadequate. The landlord simply ignored our requests for a proper fix.

Understandably, we decided not to renew our lease. However, we made this decision during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when nobody knew just how infectious and deadly the virus was, and there was no vaccine in sight.

We thought we had two choices:

1. Potentially, we could compromise our health by staying in our apartment until the end of our lease. In this scenario, we'd risk our health by letting our landlord and potential new tenants in for showings.

2. Alternatively, we could compromise our budget. We'd give the landlord an extra month's notice. We'd empty out the apartment as much as possible during the first month of our notice period, and we'd move into a new place with most of our belongings at the beginning of the second month. This way, the landlord could let people in for showings without us being there during the second month. We'd then complete moving out on days when the landlord has no showings scheduled. We'd effectively pay two rents during the second month of our notice period, but at least we would not risk contracting COVID.

The landlord agreed with the 2nd option. To our surprise, we managed to move out all our things before the second month of our notice period. But we still had to clean the apartment before handing it over. When we returned with cleaning supplies at the beginning of the second month of this arrangement, we found someone living there. Turns out, the landlord didn't need to schedule any showings. She already had someone lined up. The moment she noticed that our things were gone, she let someone else move in and thereby collected rent twice for the same apartment: rent from us and rent from the new tenant.

We suspected this wasn't just unethical, but illegal as well. When we consulted with a lawyer, they told us that this indeed constituted an illegal eviction. Despite having clear documentation of our arrangement, the landlord denied all accountability or wrongdoing and even accused one of us of being an ungrateful, belligerent immigrant.

Faucet in the bathroom doesn’t divert much of the water to the shower-head so we pay for the water bill and electricity/heat. All that money goes down the drain. My room is <55 degrees when the temp drops below 30. Won’t allow A/C but we pay the electric so there’s no sleeping after April because the upstairs is consistently 85.

Management decided to turn off the parcel lockers during the holiday season -- most packages got dumped in the mail room (because shocker: the delivery folks didn't want to locate our doors), and had multiple packages go missing -- so much so that it was easier for me to get a mailbox at the UPS store and have my packages shipped there than deal with my packages going missing constantly.

Keyfobs for the garage and doors went dead, and was told that they could not issue us replacements because ""No one knew how to work the system.""  Garage doors were broken more often than not.  Sprinklers burst during the cold weather, the hallways would flood when it rains, the natural gas was shut off to the building (with no notice to the residents...we discovered when we tried to bake a pizza and couldn't figure out why the oven wasn't getting warm), and a constant battle between the coffee maker in the public space (seriously, I cannot make this up: they wouldn't let the maintenance guys drink the coffee from the coffee maker in the community room...to the point where they *moved* the coffee machine into the leasing office, which was never open at 9:30 at night when you wanted a single cup of coffee on your way to work).

JANET URIAN AKA MAYA REALTY,US,SANTA FE,NEW MEXICO,87501,"My experience with Janet was absolutely horrendous. She attempted eviction on 3 separate occasions for false claims. One of her reasons included that I “didn’t water her garden enough” though the garden was situated in a low light area with plants that only thrive in high light. Then she made false claims about trash being left on the porch. I caught her on my doggy camera entering the apartment twice without notice or permission. She would show up to the property at odd hours, unannounced. She would call to berate me over things that were not founded in reality; at times she would be screaming and repeating the same phrase over and over, then hang up and call back, then continue to scream claiming I hung up on her. The casita had a severe mice infestation which she refused to resolve. I was catching a mouse minimum per day for at least 6 mos. She went as far as taking me to court for various false claims. I was able to collect written affidavits to provide in court from neighbors, proving she was making false claims. Her reputation was so bad, neighbors did everything they could to help protect me from her. I truly believe my situation would’ve been far worse without their affidavits and willingness to be called as witnesses, because Santa Fe is a city that gives tenants as minimal recourse as possible to protect themselves from outrageous landlords. Dealing with her was truly a nightmare and I would’ve rather lived out of my vehicle than to have dealt with what I did.",1,1,1,1,1,2023-04-18T23:09:07.247Z,false,,,false

MAIN STREET VILLAGE,US,IRVINE,CALIFORNIA,92614,"Lived at this property for over five years. Before COVID, things were ok with regards to respect. But their true colors showed after COVID. I had a rental increase of 30% in 2022 and an additional 25% rental increase in 2023. This 2023 rental hike would make my monthly rent higher than bigger units on the property. When I confronted the property managers (Maureen and Steven), they just blamed the property company and instead tried to encourage me to upsize to a new apartment. When I told them I was moving out and was done with their games, they revealed to me that they wanted me out of my apartment so that they could renovate. And setting an extremely high rate would do the job. Absolutely no respect for their tenants. You will be screwed over by Maureen and Steven and they will just claim it's out of their hands.

Other gems - the parking garage is infested with rats. I'm not sure how many of them have made their way inside of apartments. I could hear them walking around along the ceiling but never encountered any inside my unit. Also, the parking garage is huge and will take you at least 5 minutes to exit and enter if you park on the 4th or 5th floor. There's also an insane amount of speed bumps, so your suspension will be worn over time. Enjoy seeing the smashed rats on your drive in.

The amenities are fine, but they are no different than any of the 100 super complexes in the Irvine area. The best part about the complex is the maintenance staff.

During inspection to let us know what repairs we would need to make, we asked if we could leave some appliances, to which she responded that next renters would surely appreciate that. So really, she lied about selling the house so that she could jack the rent up even more after having a pretext to kick us out. After we did everything we were asked to make sure we got our deposit back, they only gave us a check for a fourth of the deposit. So now we’re taking her to court.

RENAISSANCE APARTMENT HOMES (MISSION ROCK RESIDENTIAL),US,PHOENIX,ARIZONA,85029,"Units are all given the ""landlord special"" treatment with half inch deadly smelling paint, vents are painted shut, thermostats suck, but any repairs or modifications done by the tenant are allowed for the most part as long as they're not permanent. Appliances are ridiculously old, bathtubs and counters are peeling, and a lot of the apartment is out of code (ventilation in kitchen and bathroom, fireplace hearth extension, window pane type and thickness, electrical outlets not GFCI, etc). There is a mold problem in unit bathrooms due to lack of ventilation, as the fans do not exhaust outdoors as required by code in units that do not have windows in the bathrooms. There is no noise shared between adjacent units to the sides, but noise travels up and down through units due to lack of proper noise insulation between floors. I've only ever seen 1 roach a year while living here, and the complex was prompt in spraying for them. There are frequent car break ins and cops are here at least once a week. Upper management does not take most complaints about residents seriously, sometimes resulting in harm to other residents, but other staff members go out of their way to help. Allison, the property manager, is the only real problem in the office. The swimming pools are often dirty and the spa does not heat up. The property is pretty well cleaned, though most units look run down, as do many of the residents cars. Rent is absurd for the area but it's a reasonable concession considering that the other complexes around here are a thousand times worse. Kids run around unattended- they throw rocks at cars, will run out in front of moving vehicles as a game, vandalize the property, and ruin amenities. Parents dont care. The dog park contains valley fever, so don't let your pets near it. Be prepared to have to fight on the stupidest things, but overall, we've been pretty okay here and it's certainly better than paying double the amount for a Greystar managed property instead.

TOBAGO GRUMSHIN,US,BROOKLYN,NEW YORK,11231,"If you're looking for a stable and sane landlord, do yourself a favor and steer clear of Tobago Grumshin. Living under his watchful eye has been a waking nightmare of bizarre incidents and sleepless nights. Picture Super Hans from Peep Show, give him the keys to your apartment, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what it's like to rent from Tobago.

First of all, let's talk about his nocturnal habits. The man has absolutely no concept of boundaries. I've woken up in the middle of the night to find him inexplicably fixing a leaky faucet in my bathroom while humming techno music. And the fact that he's constantly clad in a leopard print bathrobe doesn't help matters.

His obsession with eclectic music is also a cause for concern. 3 am drum solos and impromptu didgeridoo concerts are just some of the ""treats"" you can expect when living under Tobago's rule. I've tried to confront him about the noise, only to be met with nonsensical explanations about how the sounds are designed to ""align the chakras of the building.""

Maintenance requests are utterly unpredictable. I once asked him to fix a broken window, and instead, he installed a massive aquarium filled with exotic fish, claiming it would ""improve the feng shui of the place."" While it did add a certain ambiance, it did nothing to stop the draft.

The common areas are no safe haven either. The hallways are littered with obscure artwork and bizarre knick-knacks that Tobago insists have ""metaphysical properties."" I don't know about you, but I don't find it comforting to be greeted by a life-size statue of an ancient deity every time I leave my apartment.

In short, if you value your sanity and personal space, avoid renting from Tobago Grumshin at all costs. While his antics may make for entertaining anecdotes at parties, the reality of living under his watch is an exhausting and bewildering experience that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.",5,5,5,5,4,2023-04-19T03:07:43.061Z,false,"The review is negative but the ratings are positive.

The maintenance team was great, and usually showed up same or next day, we had an A/C failure, and they had it fully repaired within about 4 or 5 days - which considering they needed to replace the condenser, isnt bad.

When I moved out, the cleaning fees were reasonable, and they didn't bill me for carpet - which other complexes where I've had similar lengths of tenancy have.

BILL OR WILLIAM ANDERSON,US,EUGENE,OREGON,97402,"A mother in law in a garage turned studio/ then cut in half into a 1 bedroom. A kitchenette style kitchen with a sauna next to it. It's on septic which had some issues, but landlord was very quick to fix. The electrical there was very bad, but landlord also fixed that which is also why I gave a 5 rating for making fixes to the place. Unfortunately, a lot of the plugs/lights for the rental are inside the main house which is connected by a locked door and occupied by another person you last when I was there has a very close relationship to the landlord. Bill has been fairly reasonable, but the main reason we ended up leaving was due to the few times we asked for assistance in repairs while we weren't home and when he was in the unit by himself he ended up snooping around and left us a note about how he was upset about said thing and then followed up by a $200 rent increase.",5,5,3,2,5,2023-04-19T12:23:32.287Z,false,,,false

However, the repairs left holes in the walls, large areas of chipped paint, and dents, which were never fixed, even though we followed up many times. Even with photo proof that their repairs caused the damages, they still tried to withhold our damage deposit. The building also had laundry. However, they were usually broken and the sewage line often broke, leaving a nasty smell/liquid all over the room.

BILL BUTLER,US,CAMDEN,MAINE,04843,"The very first week my girlfriend and I moved into our downstairs apartment the plumbing was clogged in all the pipes inside the apartment. From the sink to the toilet and shower, nothing would go down. It eventually led to stuff coming back up through our pipes and into our showers and sinks. We called our landlord 3 times, the first time this happened, before hearing back form him saying that ""the last tenant must have put stuff in them."" He then followed up with telling us how we are obligated to find someone to jet out our own pipes, because ""none of his plumbers are getting back to him."" Luckily I worked for a different property management company and was able to get the pipes jetted out. Throughout the year long lease there the pipes had clogged 5 mores times and every single time it turned into it was our job to get a plumber... ontop of the plumber issue in our apartment. The apartment above us leaked from its shower which would evidently leak down water through a live outlet and into the middle of our kitchen floor. (This never got taken care of, was told that the person above us doesn't properly shut the shower curtain.) I'm lightly leaving out the cockroach, black mold, and a broken heater that consistently were problems throughout our whole lease in that apartment, that the land lord refused to address everytime they were brought up. Another real awful part of this land lord is that he doesn't get back to you when you call him. On 2 occasions while the plumbing was clogged and coming back up through the pipes he didn't respond to our calls or for a week plus. I guess the last straw was the hot water heater, the fridge and all the kitchen outlets stopped working and the landlord didn't respond for 1 week while they were all not working. Onop of having no power in half our apartment the hot water heater was leaking from a top pipe and into the electrical box on its side. From start to the end of the lease, Bill Butler has got to be the worst and lord in maine. Save yourself a headache and don't rent from this guy. Lastly he had a carpeted bathroom... in an apartment.

The management, when contacted about an issue regarding pest infestation (bedbugs), was incredibly hostile and combative, refusing to do more than have the maintenance staff (of which there was one or two for the entire building) come and spray an undisclosed chemical in the unit and arguing that because they had been in the rental game for decades, they knew their responsibilities under the LTA.

There were a lot of small things with the place that they practically refused to address though. All of the outlets were loose and plugs would fall out. We asked multiple times for them to be replaced, and it never did. A bathroom that faces the road had blinds that didn't cover the full window, exposing nude bodies to the road. Those were not replaced despite requests. They also refused to give security deposits back once we were notified they were selling the unit.

MOREHOUSE REALTY,US,WINTER PARK,FLORIDA,32789,"Rented one of their properties for 5 years. At first things are fine, but as soon as you have any issues, it quickly turns sour. Upon moving in, there were several things needing repair, which the manager said would be fixed in the coming weeks. In my 5 years, none were repaired. The AC was destroyed during a hurricane, it took 2 weeks for them to send a repairman. There was a large hole cut into the wall to install the new lines, which was not fixed for over a year despite multiple inquiries. The water heater kept busting due to improper installation, one of which times exposed wires on the machine were submerged in water, causing it to boil. We suspected mold in the vents, they sent the shoddiest handyman that sprayed the AC intake with cleaning solution while on, causing the blower motor to blow up. He also drenched the vents with Pinesol, all of which we told the property manager, to which she accused us of lying. Every single repairman sent over multiple years was very bad, the majority of the time making the issue worse. Getting them to send anyone in the first place is like pulling teeth, and photos/videos of the issues go largely ignored. After accusing us of lying when we sat there and watched this man the entire time, we were pretty much done.

I will say a good point is they never raised the rent much compared with most other places, generally around $50 per year. They didn't bother us, no inspections or anything, only had a guy come take photos of the appliances once in those 5 years. So if your apartment doesn't have any issues, they're tolerable.

I understand their position here, given the state of the rental market in Toronto, but it was over the top in my opinion.

The parking garage is filthy. They haven't cleaned it since I moved in years ago and it leaves a layer of dirt on vehicles in as little as a few days. While the property management company is good at managing their units, they have done a very poor job at managing their parking infrastructure.

AXELA SHELBOURNE,US,HARTFORD,CONNECTICUT,06130,"As a back story, the building, 50 Morgan St in Hartford is a converted 17 floor Hotel. State and federal funding for most of the private project. Did top 9 floors, now doing bottom 9 floors and lobbies. 

We were charged $75/car per month to park in a condemned garage. We got the town to shut it down. During that period we were forced to park on the surface lot that did not have enough spaces for everyone. People parked in the fire lanes, blocking the false fire alarms that would happen 3 times a week. So the town started ticket/towing people in the fire lane. Landlord would not stop leasing regardless of no parking. Would not refund people who were towed.

 Then they tried to illegally reopen the garage and start charging again before they performed any repairs (aka still condemned). Had to call head Hartford housing inspector to come and shut them down, again. 

Construction on parking garage has been going on for over year and a half. My GF and I found paperwork from the town citing over 30 code violations on FIXES on parking garage. 

We have since lost more of the parking garage area because the town had condemned it and the landlord didn't tell is for months.

There's no security in the building so one individual would sneak into our gym (covered in mirrors) and film videos for his old fans with props. He would ask innocent people going by the gym for help taking photos. They didn't know until it was too late what was happening. He did this to 5 people. Property managers knew. Didn't report to police. My GF and I figured his ID out. Police didn't nothing (no surprise). News article comes out about it and our landlord said that we were aiding and abetting the sexual predator, who is currently on bail for public exposure?? Yeah we'd help him make a video of him doing what he's out on bail for, right??

New construction was removing asbestos floor tiles with a hand pick and hammer for over 2 months while sharing space w electricians, plumbers, framers etc. They propped open fire escape doors for all 9 floors of construction so asbestos dust lines the escape. 

They tried to illegally evicted 3 people that we now of. We helped then get out of those. 3 times they tried to illegally evict us, personally. If you cause a problem (tenants union) they were just start messing with your rent ledger. People would pay rent and the next day the credit was gone. Still took the money!

Axela Shelbourne is one of the bigger ""developers' in the area who's founded mostly by his buddy, the mayor, and the state contracts he awards him.

He was trying to set up a Yashiva community in Waterbury and was still taking deposits on homes AFTER the town denied his zoning permits for the project. Soulless man. He's a volunteer EMT, and told me he was smart for making people park in the fire lanes. Because he had to support his investors.  Promised it would never impact safety.

We eventually struck a deal, one year at the same price. The whole time we lived there, we had cockroaches and mice that Nick did nothing about.

Consequently, our kitchen circuit emits a burning plastic odor when operating appliances, such as a coffee maker.

Moreover, the rental company's excavation work in the backyard has been subpar. They have neglected to clean up debris, transforming our once-pleasant outdoor space into a derelict lot. Inadequate cleanup has led to flooding issues and damage to items left on the ground. Additionally, the presence of loose pipes has attracted a number of snakes to the area.

The lawn maintenance service provided by the rental company is also unsatisfactory, as they only tend to the lawn when it becomes excessively overgrown and exhibit little care for items on the lawn during their work.

Lastly, we have experienced billing issues due to the installation of a sump pump connected to our unit's electrical panel. We have repeatedly reached out to the rental company to address the electricity cost issue, but our concerns have been met with silence.

Overall, our experience with this rental company has been highly dissatisfying, and we cannot recommend their services.",1,1,3,5,5,2023-04-19T17:03:20.865Z,false,,,false

CONs: 1st floor bedroom window didn't lock; oven didn't worked; heat/air rarely worked; washer malfunctioned; there's no wifi/internet and if you get it installed, he will most likely tell other roommates (some who are most likely freeloaders, possible criminals and possibly under age) that YOUR wifi that YOU paid to have installed is the house wifi- and if you don't give others the password, he will most likely have his suspected goons disconnect the outside cable; BTW, the owner next door at 2313 will most likely without warning do demolition/ remodeling at all hours of the day so you won't get any sleep if you work graveyard shift- and if you ask him when will the demolition end he'll most likely act like a d**k and think you're trying to ""step to him""; there's also random shootings and fires in the neighborhood; so don't be a fool like I was and rent from sebastian openheinie- from what I hear, all of his properties around the Philadelphia area are like this.

My advice for sebastian openheinie: don't scam your tenant's with tenantalert.com/tenantcloud.com and say that the security deposit equates to some fraudulent  lease guarantee. also, be more accessible to tenants when they have legitimate concerns. don't just pawn them off to your secretary. finally, if you're not going to give tenants their security deposit back, i would suggest using it to take care of the above CONs",1,1,1,1,1,2023-04-19T17:26:43.133Z,false,,,false

POINTSTAR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,US,DETROIT,MICHIGAN,48209,"I lived with Pointstar Property MGMT for about 2 years and it was a TERRIBLE experience. Cheap rent? Yes. But that was the ONLY positive thing about living in their building. Some scumlord quickly rebuilt the property (only the top floor, the 2 floors below were incomplete and units and the basement would frequently flood) and did NOT employ safe measures to renovate the building. I’m talking walls that had crumbled pst the 20 layers of paint, which meant areas were exposed outside air/insects/critters. Mold and mildew was present on the ceilings, especially after heavy rainfall. The ceiling of the stairwell was actively crumbling and you could see exposed concrete; they never bothered cleaning up the plaster everywhere that likely had lead. There were cracks between the floorboard and wall, also leading to outside exposure. Once, the maintenance man walked into my apartment without knocking after I reported a gas leak, he did not solve the problem and was rude with ME because I was upset he entered w/o knocking. When we were moving out, I still had a day left on my lease and they sent maintenance ILLEGALLY and moved all remaining items in the apartment to a “storage unit” (most likely a random room), and scratched up my guitar and lost some of our cleaning supplies.

FRANCES ALLEN,US,BELLINGHAM,WASHINGTON,98225,"My experience with this landlord was that she's well intentioned, but does have a lack of awareness of and adherence to WA laws regarding tenant rights, and personally holds ideals and priorities that made being her tenant continuously confusing, unsafe, time-consuming, and stressful. 
Within a month of living there, a no-notice entry occurred when a handyperson and landscaper I'd never met were allowed entry without any housemate being given notice until we came home to them in the utility closet; this was after a weather/downpour-related flooding incident we'd informed our landlord about which, granted, did need to be looked into for water damage. We let her know this was not legal or acceptable to not give us some kind of notice. She claimed to have forgotten, seeming to have a very casual view of the lawful 48-hour notice before entry.
Additionally, the house had a years-long squirrel infestation in its attic prior to my moving in (several soffits where the squirrels had chewed around old hardware cloth which once covered them became their regular entry points), including having chewed through the ceiling in a bathroom which had been patched up, and through the same bathroom's window screen (which we repaired ourselves with a screen patch we paid for out of pocket). Within a couple months of moving in, I heard daily scratching and activity in the attic above a shared studio room, and squirrels then chewed through some electrical wires which cut off power to parts of upstairs and the laundry room. The wiring was promptly fixed and power restored by her handyperson; however, she claimed to have heard pest control was a scam and apparently would not consider it further. The audible squirrel scratching/activity in the attic continued, and so fearing the potential for an electrical fire and/or dealing w/ a squirrel getting into the main parts of the house, my housemates and I began using (and paying for out of pocket for) large quantities of cinnamon powder, Hot Pepper Wax Animal Repellent spray, and a dubious plug-in ""electropulse"" Pest Repeller. We used the cinnamon and spray in the chewed-though soffits weekly, which were parallel to the attic area we heard the most scratching and activity. We often pounded on the studio room's ceiling whenever we heard the scratching and rustling, sometimes daily. After well over a year of this, our landlord's handyperson gave us hardware cloth and ceramic screws (which were unfortunately barely a usable size w/ the 1/4"" mesh hardware cloth) to re-cover the attic soffits ourselves in the places they'd been chewed through. We spent several hours trying to be thorough and make the nearly too small screws work with the hardware cloth in order to get it done.
At another point, our rental house's ""exterior"" studs (the house is very old and apparently had two sets of studs/walls, internal and external?) were found to be rotting at the base along one side of the house where dirt had built up and allowed water to sit. When the handyperson applied multiple coats of wood hardener to the base of many of these studs, the entire house instantly smelled of the fumes inside, which we had to ask about since we were given no information prior. Our housemate, who worked from home full-time during covid in the room right next to most of the application of wood-hardener, experienced regular headaches for weeks. Our landlord did give us a box fan to ventilate the adjacent living room. The fumes stayed in the house that we could smell for over two months, and eventually were only noticeable in the under-stair storage closet for up to a year after.
Our landlord also never fully addressed the guest toilet that ran ever 30 minutes in the several years I lived there, aside from the handyperson wiping the lip of the flush valve, which we informed her had not stopped the toilet from running. The large window above the kitchen sink usually dripped and pooled water on the sill when it rained too hard, and unfortunately was never addressed.
Lastly, we were told after the fact, that a housemate had failed to pay their portion of rent for two months before they later moved out. We were never even informed of this at any point by our landlord until after this housemate moved out of state. Unpaid rent, according to our group lease, was to be taken out of our collective deposits, which ultimately were; however, because our landlord initially made a verbal agreement with this housemate and then never told us, we were the ones who still had to pay for the landlord's personal choice to make private agreements outside of the lease with a single housemate. I would have preferred to be informed when the initial portion of rent was not paid in order to be a part of an in-person discussion to address it, so all housemates could have the opportunity to make and sign a written agreement for a timeline of how our deposits will be repaid by the housemate. Alternatively, because our landlord had instead made a private verbal agreement with this housemate, and our landlord then only told us after the housemate moved out of state, I do believe it should have been the landlord's responsibility to take the housemate to small claims court to recoup the missing rent, as we were never informed of this housemate's missing portion of rent or their private verbal agreement until the opportunity for direct communication and accountability with this housemate was made more challenging.
Thankfully, our water heater was promptly replaced after the old one stop working, and the upstairs shower drain was promptly re-sealed with the proper material to address a sudden leak due to improper calking material being used at some point, likely a long time ago. The area this leak affected on the laundry room's ceiling was also removed and patched up.",2,2,3,1,2,2023-04-19T18:40:19.670Z,false,,,false

DENISE SMITH,US,COLUMBUS,OHIO,43204,"Nightmare landlord! She was very disrespectful and mean to me. I am so happy that I don’t live there anymore. It’s a rooming house and it started off great at first. She started off being nice ish. I did avoid her because she would gossip and say mean things about past tenants and people she know. It made me uncomfortable but that was the only flaw at first. I was always polite whenever I saw her, even when she started being cruel to me (didn’t want to anger her and lose my place. Month to month lease once she hates you and spreads rumors it’s over. You are out). She does repairs in a timely manner. The place is safe, but it was very gross due to other tenants. I often cleaned the place without complaints. Cleaning calms me so I didn’t mind being responsible for cleaning the whole house. If anything, it made me less stressed since I could decompress that way after a long day of work and school. However, that ended up being how I coped when she turned on me. I kept to myself so her sudden switch came out of nowhere. I barely spoke to her and when I did I was polite (I am a quiet person so I mainly nodded and said short responses). Utilities are included! The rent price was fair. When the landlord started to hate me she started to lie that I was dirty… There was now gossip and rumors about me. It was so hard being treated that way. It was terrible when the tenants joined in on the bullying. There were times when after I move my packages would be sent there by mistake. I forgot to change the address so a few times things got sent there before I changed it. She was mean and never gave them to me. So I lost money that way. Idk why she kept them? My clothes size were too small for her (not trying to be mean) so it makes no sense to keep it. Unless it was to be petty? Idk. The house looks nice. The room was nice too. It was just the hostile environment that I took issue with. I would have stayed much longer if she was respectful. Looking back, I wish that I had the strength to stand up for myself. She was so mean. It made me feel so bad about myself. She also goes back on her word a lot. She would say that something was okay then switch up on you. She did it many times and then berated me for it. She okayed things verbally so it was easy to gaslight me. “You can use the sugar in the common area! That’s okay. I got it for the house” then gets mad at me when I use the sugar in front of her a few days later. I also lacked confidence and just got out of an abusive situation so I was not in any shape to defend myself even if I wanted to. I didn’t know how to speak up for myself so I blamed myself and dealt with the mean comments. My advice for if you want to move in, keep to yourself (like I have did the whole time). That is my only advice. I don’t know what else you can do to avoid her toxicity. Maybe, speaking up for yourself is something that could make your experience better than mine? I never spoke up for myself and just took it. If you speak up for yourself than she probably wouldn’t target you. She probably only messed with me because I am a weak person.",5,3,1,1,1,2023-04-19T18:53:51.637Z,false,,,false

They commited five instances of voyeurism, but called the cops and said we were being publicly indecent, in our own home. We did not know we could be seen, or were being seen. We never got a warning. It felt like a violation of our own privacy.
Never bothered to remedy the situation herself; served us substantial breach papers and she ""did not want to"" go to the RTDRS after we served our rejection to the eviction.
Also never told us our suite was unregistered with the City of Calgary. Black mold is also forming in the bathroom. The heat doesn't work properly in the basement. You can't park in the back in the winter. There's this huge ice puddle that forms and no salt was provided when asked. They never check the property and it's conditions out of their own free will. 
Also, she will not return the damage deposit depsite us giving the place back in better condition than when she initially gave it to us (fruit flies in the drains, cigarette butts everywhere, dead flies on the windowsills, crusty bathroom). 
We filed with the RTDRS about our deposit. 
Everyone we talked to about this told us to leave immediately as the situation honestly felt ""suspicious, scammy, and scummy"". 
We felt no respect and felt our privacy was completely violated.
Her solution to everything when you complained was ""just call the cops"".

They took $100 off of my rent that month after I asked for more. Once only gave us 47 hours notice for a showing and did not respond to us when we told them 48's the legal minimum.

This hole remained for 9 months before they finally patched it, and they still didn’t fix the leak so the ceiling was dripping water again within weeks. 
They turned off the hot water 1-2 times a week for the entire day without notice. There was a constant leak in the basement plumbing that turned the wall to mush and grew mold. It was there for over a year when I finally moved out and they still hadn’t fixed it. 
They’re great about making quick bandaid fixes but never actually solving the problem. 
They also raised rent above legal guidelines 3 years in a row. 
The property manager was a nightmare and was rude every time I spoke to him, talking to me like I was inconveniencing him by asking for basic repairs to my apartment. Several times he yelled at me for asking for updates on repairs I had already requested dozens of times. 
They’re also notorious for entering the apartment without notice. I didn’t know they did this until one day my boyfriend went to my apartment one day while I was still at work and they just walked in. He called and asked if they had given notice, I said no so he told them they should leave and come back after proper notice was given and their response was “you can try and stop us from entering but we have a key so good luck with that” and when he closed the door and locked it, they unlocked it and again let themselves in.

Heard from previous renters that the entire unit flooded and the landlord cheaped out choosing to only dry the walls and never checked for mould. Multiple doors and widows do no close during winter letting wind and snow inside or rain in the summer.

Doesn't do follow up and tries to scam renters by making them pay professional fees when contractors are brought in to repair the results of her negligence. A bunch of illegal work has been started and never finished leaving dangerous spots all around the property (like a wooden patio fence leaning on electrical wires that could fall at any point with just enough wind or exterior stair guardrails not anchored). One of the renters' kitchen sink has been leaking water for over 6 years and she refuses to fix it and instead let the entire floor and ceiling of the unit below slowly rot.

Heard from previous renters that when the unit flooded, she didn't have proper insurance and wasn't covered leaving the renter's insurance to sue the owner in order to recoup the destroyed belonging. 

Potential renters, while the inside looks cute, stay away from this mouldy health hazard and horrible landlord who's neglecting her duty. She only keeps the place as a cash cow with no intention of ever dealing with the place.

Cons: He entered the unit illegally. He would not give any notice that he was coming and would not knock before entering the apartment.  He screamed at tenants. He threatened to steal our things. He only seems to rent to people who he thinks will not know rental laws and gets very angry if/when you are able to quote the RTA to show him that he is engaging in illegal activities.

HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS LIMITED,CA,CAMBRIDGE,ONTARIO,N1S3V6,"Writing review for Grandview Tower in Cambridge (180 Grand Ave South). Absolute mess from start to finish. Did not have a working fridge until the day before I moved in (this was noticed by me and the only reason it was resolved was because I drove into town from a different city a few days before my move to ensure it had actually been replaced - it had not). I did end up breaking my lease in order to move (I was there for less than 2 months total), I found someone to complete a lease takeover and paid the fee for them to ""relist"" the apartment even though I was the one who created the Kijiji post and found the new tenant.

In terms of Head Office (who I had to involve to get anything done), I dealt with Scott Pauls, who was the property manager (competent and professional, not too much to say about him) and also Katlyn Van Bommel (incredible, competent and helpful woman!). Onsite staff, Dan, was entirely useless. I'm not sure if I did something to personally offend him but he was a righteous pain in the ass for no reason and had far too much attitude for someone who was absolutely useless at actually doing his job and communicating the correct information. I think the only reason I was able to successfully reassign my lease was because I triple checked everything he was doing with head office. He told people the incorrect date for move in, said they weren't doing in person showings because of Covid (totally untrue) and generally seemed annoyed with me whenever he saw me.

Kind of crotchety as a person but once he got to know you was pleasant and reasonable only if you were reasonable to begin with. Doesn't deal well with angry or argumentative tenants.

TRICIA CORRIGAN - ONTARIO LTD 2422126,CA,SCARBOROUGH,ONTARIO,M1G1J5,"The utter definition of a slum lord. Just a little info: my boyfriend and I were renting the basement unit. I always paid the rent on time or early. 

1. Because of the shoddy work done by her husband, the basement ceiling is leaks water. The first time she seemed concerned. However as leaking kept happening, she starting dismissing the obvious water damage as condensation. 

2. Upon looking at the property, she said the items in the backyard would be cleared out. Upon moving in I soon discovered that her husband uses the backyard as a dumping ground for old AC parts, scrap metal etc. Whenever my boyfriend tried to clean up the place and put his junk to one side, he would just dump more stuff all over the place. 

3. They started construction upstairs and they cut through the ceiling and we had ceiling debris fall into our food while cooking dinner. They regular had saws and hammering going on after 7pm and on the weekends. When we reached out to the landlord, she said we were being immature and she didn’t have time for this. 

4. I subsequently called 311, because her husband and the workers they hired wouldn’t stop. At that point they began sending harassing messages to my boyfriend. 

5. When we gave notice to end the tenancy, she refused to respond to any realtors. She would answer and then say she would call back and never call back. As a result we lost out on a few homes.

After this experience I have zero sympathy for some of these landlords. My landlord before this one was a fantastic woman and I only moved because I transferred to a different work location.

ZULICH ENTERPRISES LIMITED,CA,SUDBURY,ONTARIO,P3E2K6,"Zulich was horrible. My bedroom had water leaking through the ceiling and dripping onto my bed. The brown water stain on the ceiling was a metre in diameter. Another water leak occurred above my bathtub, and eventually resulted in a hole in the ceiling 7” in diameter. I also had significant buckling of the parquet flooring, about 10 sq ft.

I informed the building manager numerous, numerous times about this, I also filed formal maintenance requests, and called the head office (no one answered the phones). It took them over a year to respond. Their “fix” included paint over the damage and not fixing the actual leaks. The paint wasn’t the same shade as the original, so there was a giant extra white square on the ceiling. The leaks persisted and just caused water damage and brown staining over the paint jobs.

During COVID-19, they made laundry free, only to increase the cost of laundry immediately after masks were no longer required in the province.

One of my parents unexpectedly died, and I was late on one month’s rent as a result. I told the building manager about this and that I’ll pay the rent in about a week when I got paid (I just returned to work after my dad’s death) again, and a week later I got an eviction notice. I was going through the most difficult time of my life. I had a good paying job, but because I had to be home to take care of the aftermath of my father’s death, I wasn’t able to go to work, and thus, get paid.

A month before I was moving out, the building manager decided to tell me that I had access to an underground parking spot and locker despite them assigning me an exposed parking spot when I first moved in.

I lived in two different apartment buildings with Zulich, and the “updates” they did to these units was reminiscent of the early 2000s despite it being 2018-2020. “Landlord special” type work. They also love having your fridge door open away from your kitchen. Just absolute laziness of their contractors.

From that point on the harassment began. He threw temper tantrums when I wouldn’t just leave. He called the cops on my girlfriend and accused her of trespassing, yelled and screamed in my face and basically acted like a child when he didn’t get his way. He went as far as calling the cops one night claiming I assaulted his mother when she tried to talk to me about the drying running at 11pm. His mother and he lied to the police and told them that I pushed her and they wanted me arrested. Thankfully I had a camera in my unit that captured video and audio for the entire night and it showed that I hadn’t gone near them and there was no noise suggesting a struggle (mother claimed she screamed when I pushed her).

The director will call you to make it seems like you are a valued tenant, but will lie about the work done. I don't mind the delays if whitin reason, but they will rarely keep you up to date.

Units flood regularly, water shut offs once a week, sometimes lasting 25-48 hours without notice, constant break-in because they won’t fix the exterior door locks, charges after move outs even if the move out inspection paperwork is good. Allows problem tenants to continue living in the building even after harassing other tenants, causing non stop damage and noise disturbances to the rest of the building, and even after assaulting them. Discloses private information to other tenants like Full legal names, medication information, when a tenant is away/home, which vehicle is owned by which tenant.

DUPUIS REALTY,US,SOMERVILLE,MARYLAND,02145,"Renting in the Winter Hill side of Somerville, I have plenty of horror stories about how DuPruis Realty handled issues and complaints. First, apartments that they offer are very much the ""ikea special"" and look very good on the surface but the build quality lets it down: no pipes or hvac was properly sealed meaning each connection to the bathroom, kitchen sink, dishwasher, refrigerator, had a 1 inch+ gap around the entire thing. This makes a highway for roaches and you quickly realize that there was no winning. Their solution was to lay down some expanding foam which was amazingly ineffective. After multiple calls the handyman left a large note on our door saying that we should ""clean our apartment more often"" which was insulting considering the fact that most of the wall connections weren't sealed.

Noise complaints are not taken seriously and you will be directed to contact the police (protip - if you are finding yourself in this situation you should 100% call the police and be sure to pass along the property management information and that they were the ones who advised you to do so).

The Tub was a refitting but as we found out was actually just a spray on ceramic which was so badly applied it chipped and peeled weeks after having it reapplied in the apartment (smelled like pineapple garbage). After some research this is because they never sanded the surface and literally just came there to apply it and call it a day.

Rent was raised every time the lease was renewed and contacting the office was very hit or miss since they have a single person as the point of contact. If the mail is late with your check you'll get a call regularly until the postal service gets there. While hounding you they will not accept electronic payments of any kind.

Genuinely I can't stress how terrible they were as a rental property company and would highly advise anything else.

DUBRICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CA,WATERLOO,ONTARIO,N2L1W7,"I live in a 3 story low-rise complex. Dubrick has been a good management company and are prompt with investing major issues such as plumbing. They're less responsive with non-emergency type requests (ie rotten cabinets and countertops). Our super intendant is really responsive to text messages and usually available to help if needed.
Biggest complaints here are:
1. No visitor parking - guests (and tenants with 2 vehicles) can park on the street and be ticketed if they want to.
2. Inaccessible for deliveries - shipping companies have no access to the building and there are no mailboxes outside; unless you're always home to let them in, you'll need to have a second address to receive deliveries.",4,4,5,5,3,2023-04-20T01:04:32.440Z,false,False review,,false
JENINE WATSON,CA,BARRIE,ONTARIO,L4N1B7,"The landlord refuses to clean common areas. Multiple tenants have informed her of the laundry room being dirty (bottles and lint everywhere, machines have old dirty liquid stuck on them) and she said she can't send someone to clean and adults should clean up after themselves. In the last 2 years she only cleaned it once because she was trying to rent out a unit. She created a 'recycling schedule' for tenants to bring the whole buildings recycling to the curb. If tenants don't do it, it will pile up for weeks outside the front doors. There is garbage all over the property that rarely gets cleaned.
Not only is the property filthy, she also harassed tenants to move. She has offered tenants money to move, and even after saying no she will send links to other rentals pressuring them to move out. 
When I had an active leak she wanted me to wait two days before sending someone to fix it. This was not a small leak either, and where is was positioned I couldn't even put buckets down to catch to water, so it was leaking all over the floor. As well as we had issues with the latch on our window breaking, she never fixed it after weeks of asking her to. Eventually we had to order the parts and fix it ourselves.",2,1,3,3,1,2023-04-20T01:27:59.002Z,false,,,false
BOB BUNKER,CA,WATERLOO,ONTARIO,N2J1K7,"Bob Bunker is a Brokerage Manager for Trillium West Brokerage in Guelph and a very negligent landlord.

He hides behind a false ""property management company"" who does his bidding. They do not provide their ""company"" name. Just a random woman who has access to a Gmail account which is the address of the property. 

Here is a long list of RTA violations that Bob Bunker committed. 

- Failed to provide his service address on the Ontario Standard Lease. 
- Interfered with reasonable enjoyment of the property having his ""property management company"" send over their ""maintenance person"" to take photos and spy. 
- Did not provide snow removal for the property. 
- Tried to include supplemental pages of void clauses contradictory to the RTA. 
- Failed to maintain appliances necessary for living, a refrigerator. 
- Failed to provide an inspection and/or abatement after a pipe burst on the property. 
- Illegally locked his tenants out of their unit on the coldest night of the year 2023.
- Coerced a tenant who he locked out of their unit to terminate their tenancy for compensation. 

The list can go on. Bob Bunker does not act alone. This property is an investment property with his other negligent landlord goons.

HIBERNIA APARTMENTS,US,COLUMBUS,OHIO,43232,"Pros:
Nice forest setting with patios/balconies.
Large floorplans for the price.
Very convenient to 270 and 70.
Gas heat/stove, if you're into that. I am.
Remodeled with new appliances, countertops, and flooring a couple years ago.

Cons:
Remodeled vinyl flooring was glued onto the existing linoleum without cleaning. Becomes unglued when wet. God help you if you have kids that splash in the bathtub. Random ""planks"" started coming up within a month of the install, no need for water to help them along.
Remodel project also painted white over the wood cabinets. Paint immediately chipping off around the hinges. At least the new countertops are decent.
My AC has been broken for a year now. Maintenance took months to even look at it or try to address it. Once summer finished they gave up and promised a new condenser this spring. I'll believe it when I see it. Spent a grand on 2 portable AC units to try keep up during summer, enough to keep the bedroom and living room tolerable (but enjoy the 85F+ bathroom and kitchen). Maybe that's why they're taking their sweet time. No rent credits when asked.
Painted over mold in the bathroom. Maintenance guy even commented on it on their first visit, but nothing was done. Paint flaking off all over those painted-over moldy areas.
Insufficient parking. Good luck finding a spot after 5-6pm. You can park in the unlit guest areas instead.
Increasing crime. Cars getting broken into or stolen by Kia Boys. Shootings, stabbings. Had to get the police to let us walk through a crime scene where someone bled out on the sidewalk to get to our stairwell. Got woke up by gun shots the other night... went to look it up on the local news, they had a story about an unrelated shooting at the complex later that morning. Had a narcotics raid in the unit below me a couple years ago... cops shot out the windows and threw flashbangs inside. Great experience with young children! Counted 14 CPD in riot gear coming up the stairwell on my doorbell cam. Unit sat for months with shot-out windows, open to the elements.
Amazon/doordash/etc. have trouble finding your unit with the confusing layout and signage. About 80% chance your items will be stolen if misdelivered.
Lots of non-functioning lighting in common areas and sketchy twisty wood steps in the stairwells with broken trellises.
Many of the garages have water drainage issues, wonky doors, and plants growing inside. People park in the no-parking areas in front of the garages, leaving you no room to get in or out.
Giant dog sh!t all over the common areas. Don't walk through the grass.

ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CA,BURLINGTON,ONTARIO,L7L6A3,"Finally I can write a review for these guys without being terrified of their bully legal team. I tried to rent a unit back in 2020, they asked for three months rent to secure and I did. Signed all the paperwork, had a move in day and even booked movers, hydro, internet and all.

On the posting it had been indicated pet's were okay and there were no restrictions, so on my application I indicated I had a pet. Weeks after giving them my money and signing documents I get a call from the realtor asking me about my dog, which I found strange told them more about the size (small) and moved on. 

The next day they suddenly reach out telling me I need a co-signer, I who lives alone, single, no credit issues had no one to cosign for me they then told me I could give another two months rent to secure the unit. 

There was no way I was going to shell out 5 months rent - so they claimed I caused the deal to fall through and cancelled. During this time the LTB was closed and backlogged, so Royal York kept my close to 7k and withheld it only giving me a contract to release 2k of this money.

In desperation I did (I was now out of an apartment and had to live out of a family friend's whole in limbo looking for another opening for an apartment with another company). A year and a half down the line the LTB indicates in our meeting they were in the wrong, however because I signed the document I was out the money.

The management is downright terrible. They show no interest in fixing anything. The gym has been missing weights for months (they were stolen), and the laundry machines are always broken. The pool is closed more often than it's open, and the roads are a minefield of potholes. My car was broken into, and packages were stolen from the package room regularly.

Yes, maintenance is slow, but I’ve never had an issue with getting things fixed. They added lockers to keep packages from getting stolen. I love the neighborhood, great schools and what not.

HEE-JOON BAEK,CA,MONTREAL,QUEBEC,H2V2R2,"Slumlord with a smile--

When we moved in the landlord didn't have the place ready and our hot water was off for the first week. The unit was not legal, either.
I had a backwater pipe that failed and was kept that way for the duration of a year long lease. I was frequently having backwater pump up through my drains all over my floors for a year. My toilet was unusable most of the time, for up to a week or two. Eventually there was just a large hole left there that wasn't repaired by the time I moved out so I was brushing my teeth on very flimsly boards covering a jagged, dirt pit in front of my bathroom sink. The insulation was non-existent, the hot water tank barely had 5 minutes of water, I'm pretty sure I was paying my neighbour's Hydro electricity bill for a year as well. The provided appliances all lacked lightbulbs and only two outlets in the entire apartment worked. These requests for a decent living space were ignored and largely, I would recommend not renting from them as all of their buildings are apparently like this, as I was told by the plumber who I basically saw at least twice a month for an entire year as my bathroom was barely functional.

RENTAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,US,GRAND JUNCTION,COLORADO,81501,"Repair rating: 5/5
Repairs are prompt and hassle-free, no issues.

Health and Safety rating: 5/5
No issues.

Rental Stability rating: 2/5
There have been no improvements to the property beyond basic maintenance, yet the annual increases in rent have significantly outpaced the rate of inflation.

Tenant Privacy rating: 3/5
Mostly good, but notice prior to entering units is lacking. Reasonable notice, generally interpreted as at least 24 hours, is required by Colorado law, but less is usually given. Additionally, the window of time typically outlined in the notice is unacceptable, e.g. ""between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, or we might not get to your unit today at all, in which case we'll show up sometime the next day."" Finally, the only notice this landlord provides is a print-out left at each tenant's door. Notice by text, email, and/or phone call would go a long way toward preventing the potentially-dangerous situation of workers attempting to access a tenant's home without the tenant being aware.

JADE ADDISON,US,ADDISON,TEXAS,75001,"Over a decade of apartment living, and Jade Addison has been the worst apartment I've ever stayed in. Their reviews online looked super solid, until I learned that they are all bought for with cash prize raffles.

The apartment I am in has next to no climate control. It regularly gets over 80 degrees in the apartment during summer, even with the A/C on full blast all day. This results in electric bills over $200 each month, which is an insane amount to have to pay to just be sweating in my apartment. It's just as bad in the winter. It was common to have the apartment get below 60 degrees no matter what the heat was set to. This caused the apartment to be miserable in both the summer and the winter. Any attempts to have this remedied was met with gaslighting management assuring me that this was completely normal, and I was ridiculous for implying otherwise.

The apartment is so old, that the chances of things being repaired is very low. Prior to this apartment, I can count on one hand the amount of times I have had to open a work order request. I have had to open over a dozen requests to have things fixed, and the success rate with that process has been very low. It is very common to hear that things can not be fixed due to the parts no longer being sold. It's clear management has no desire to resolve issues if it would cost them a dime to do so.

The noise during the summer is the worst out of any place I have lived, even including college. It's common to have the pool frequented by screaming children as early as 9 AM and as late as 2 AM. Working from home during this time was nearly impossible due to this amount of non-stop noise.

All in all, it's insane the amount of money they are charging for such an awful apartment. They could cut my rent in half, and I still would have zero desire to renew my lease. I can not get out of here fast enough.",1,1,1,1,1,2023-04-20T04:24:36.606Z,false,,,false

INSTEAD, I was kept up by the neighbours until 5 am almost every night. Because the apartment was long and narrow, there was always at least one person being loud, causing noise pollution, keeping me awake or distracting me from work. And here's the thing: they weren't even being that loud - the apartment had literally ZERO noise blocking between both vertical neighbours and horizontal neighbours. I could hear phone conversations, I could hear TV's, I could hear people practicing flute and guitar, I could hear people having sex, I could hear people producing music, I could hear conversations, and I could hear parties as if I was in the room. I moved my bed to the kitchen to avoid hearing neighbours. After I moved it to the kitchen, my other neighbours threw a party in their kitchen. I broke out in tears multiple times, there was nothing I could do to escape the constant bombardment of noise. I could literally hear exactly what people were saying even if they were talking softly. I complained about this constantly and nothing ever happened. When I moved out I said it was because of the noise. Somehow she had the nerve to say she never heard any complaints. It was one of the worst years of my life. If you are misleading potential tenants to this level, your legality as a landlord should be questioned and you should be prosecuted by law.

We moved in and the microwave, fridge, and tiles were broken. We tried to move out within 30 days because of their ""guarantee"" that but they reneged on it “because of COVID."" Like we could EVER use COVID as an excuse for not paying rent.

The ""wood floors"" are stickers and are constantly coming up. We had an infestation of ants and now mini-water bugs! The sap from the trees covers the car every morning - not to mention all the spiders that cover our car mirror every morning. Living with the dumpster is a horrible experience too - we can't back out of our driveway because the recycling bins are moved in front of it. Not to mention the flies!!!

There were stains all over the carpet when we moved in, like they didn't replace or clean it from the prior tenant - paint stains all over the railings and carpet too.

We left after less than a year despite paying a ton to move! Lots of sq footage eaten up by stairs (52 to get from the car to the primary bedroom)! The walls are also paper thin. The staff do not care. Maintenance doesn't care. In 7 months, two of our neighbors have moved and now we know why. DO NOT MOVE HERE!

ETA: 7 emails from this week filled with typos and mistakes, unreadable links. Then we get this doozy - NO MAINTENANCE for the foreseeable future. How can they renege on a signed contract and change the contract without both parties agreeing? I literally got laughed at since we have TWO tickets in and they’ve been in for a month+ now (water stains on the ceiling and no cold water in the primary bath) and asked about rent rebates. Still waiting to hear about our requests and nothing from them. ETA x 2: garbage flies, no recycling pick-up for days, still haven't ""fixed"" or painted over the ceiling leaks, packages missing, no lawn/leaf maintenance, major car break ins and accidents happening...Please do not waste your time or money here!",1,3,1,1,1,2023-04-20T02:00:49.951Z,false,Too long didn't read,,false

EQUITON LIVING ADANAC CROSSING,CA,KITCHENER,ONTARIO,N2P1Z4,"- Cockroaches have been seen in building.
- 1 of the 2 elevators have been unavailable consistently for nearly two years, despite having been replaced entirely 
- Building management is unable or unwilling to address noise complaints
- unclear how to make maintenance requests; there are paper forms that never get answered when submitted, and an online tenant portal that also doesn't seem effective. usually I just call or email the office now, which seems to work well enough. 
- Generally responsive to maintenance issues overall, including plumbing and drywall repair concerns. Less likely to fix smaller items.
- Frequent water shut off notifications that never actually result in the water being turned off, which is mostly just weird. 
- There were false alarms from smoke detectors occurring pretty regularly for a while but it looks like they upgraded the building's system, which is good
- VERY inconsistent staffing, which can get confusing. There's usually 2-4 couples working on site as support, office, or cleaning staff, but the turnover is incredibly high which leads to inconsistency in the way that you communicate with them and can negatively impact the cleanliness of the buildings/property.

VANCE JOUDREY,CA,HALIFAX,NOVA SCOTIA,B3L1S1,Worst landlord I've had. The apartment itself was not well kept by the landlord. The tennants below me had major mold and water damage issues he did not repair. My experience with repairs was that he would only ever fix something if it was absolutely necessary. A broken toilet? Yes. But a light fixture on the porch roof that was leaking through with water? Never. Whenever I did communicate with him I felt like I had to be careful not to anger him. Whenever he came by the unit for maintenance he would always be on the phone yelling at someone. It scared me. I eventually found myself another place and was so relieved to never have to deal with him again. He honestly scared me.

SUSHEELA BARU,CA,WATERLOO,ONTARIO,N2T1H8,"Ms. Baru seemed to be extremely distrustful as a landlord, believing from the offset that there would be trouble with us as tenants based on her opinion of previous tenants. She even claimed that she would withhold our legal last month rent deposit as a damage deposit illegally. 

Throughout our rental period, Ms Baru exercised her right to have the house reassessed for sale, though she kept maintaining that she would not sell and displace us. We believe that she did try to illegally evict us by claiming that an above allowance rent increase was necessary to cover her carrying costs, and that should we be unable to pay she would have to let one of her children live there. She did eventually back down once we asked her to send the correct notices. 

Overall, Ms Baru was very hands-off except in cases where she seemed to want to cash in on her property. I would not recommend her as a landlord and believe that she charges too much for the property.",3,3,2,5,2,2023-04-20T14:25:23.939Z,false,,,false
LAMPE TOWERS,CA,THORNHILL,ONTARIO,L3T2B9,"Terrible place to live. Stay far away

The building is absolutely infested with bedbugs, or at least the 3rd floor is.

Every few months there are random 'inspections' (because they KNOW they will find them) followed by a completely pointless and ineffectual chemical spray. New neighbours moving in would inevitably get them too after just a few weeks, and since units are only treated one at a time to save money (instead of quarantining the floor/building like you are supposed to) the bugs just move around as they're driven from one apartment to another.

They also engage in illegal rent increases through sneaky means. I was told the garage was to be renovated, with my parking spot temporarily moved outside. When renovations were 'finished', I was not informed. Then had my fees jacked way up after asking to move back inside. 

Terrible bookkeeping as well -- we would frequently get eviction notices for non-payment of rent EVEN WHEN WE PAID IN FULL. We would have to go through the entire ordeal of contacting a paralegal and going through the tenant board only for them to block it (obviously, since we paid!). 

We ended up moving away because we could not afford the legal fees that would have been required to fight it all.

ERIC PON,CA,VANCOUVER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V5Y1X5,"Eric is a really easy going, nice landlord. His rents are always fairly reasonable and he never tries to raise them more than he’s legally allowed. He stays out of your business as long as you’re quiet and pay your rent on time. I’ve painted my place and he’s fine with that. Biggest complaint is maintenance. He’ll cut a hole in your wall to fix a leaky pipe and then just use duct tape to repair the hole in the wall. Shelf falling down? Just stick a broom handle under it to hold it up. That kind of thing. As long as it works, right? Another complaint is that I know he’s entered my suite without notice but I can’t prove it. I did find a paper coffee cup that wasn’t mine in a garbage can though. And my shower curtain had been opened when I know I had it closed. My neighbour told me that he came in to her apartment with some potential buyers (he was selling the building) while she was in bed, asleep. She was a nurse and worked some weird shifts so that’s why she was in bed during the day. Anyway, it scared the crap out of her.

They removed a lot of services like lockout services and complimentary parking for EV chargers in the public lot while raising rents dramatically.

Never repaid me for anything that I paid for out of pocket despite promising to. Tried to force me into a new, worse lease before I'd even spent three weeks in the apartment by claiming that ""month-to-month"" meant that I had to sign a new lease EVERY month. Used the apartment for his own personal storage. Stopped paying the power bill that he was responsible for. Blamed me for the upstairs tenants destroying his house and literally filling the property with garbage. Told the police that I threw a rock OUT of my own kitchen window at the neighbours when the exact opposite had happened. Tried to insist that I owed him a rent deposit AFTER I moved in, and tried to evict me based on false & self-contradictory evidence. Lied himself blue in the face trying to convince the LTB that I had done ANYTHING wrong.

They raised our rent, threatened legal action when we tried to move out. They also refused the first 3 replacements we found for them, and took days to reply each time, meaning we had to pay an extra month of rent even though we have moved out, as no one had been approved to take the apartment over yet. The appartement had gotten the “landlord” paint job (white over everything) which did damage the internet plug and some of the door hinges.

SCHOTTENSTEIN REAL ESTATE GROUP,US,COLUMBUS,OHIO,43035,"I've lived in 2 different Schottenstein Real Estate Group rental properties over the last 7 years, and can't say enough good for their amenities, staff, maintenance team, rental plans, and community events and engagement. The communities are laid out well, they have phenomenal pool, patio, pet, garden, workout, business, and event facilities. The staff and maintenance team are top notch, super helpful and responsive. I've never had any questions or maintenance requests go beyond same-day response/service, which is outstanding. There are tons of events to suit families, adults, and kids regularly, and they have weekly food trucks come in, which is a ton of fun to meet neighbors and enjoy good food. The apartment units are nice as well, as it goes for apartments. I've always lived in a 2 bed townhouse style unit, so my comments should be considered applicable to that experience. Having a 2 bed, 2.5 bath townhome with an attached garage at the prices offered is a great find. The newer communities have granite countertops and deep, large kitchen sinks, sleek cabinetry, crown moulding in the living area, large windows with quality blinds. On the downside - storage is a challenge - the newer properties offer a kitchen island, but it sacrifices storage space tremendously compared to earlier SRE Group kitchens. Bedroom closets in the townhomes offer a great deal of space for clothes hanging, but are narrow which doesn't allow for much more(eg shoes or other storage). they're workable, but you need to be creative with the space offered. Based on my personal experience, I wish the townhomes were a bit larger, to offer more storage - but they're very nice units none the less. The lease terms are the best you'll find. After a 12 month lease term, you move to a month to month set up, where the conditions of the lease still apply, but you only need provide 30 day notice if you intend to move out. That allows for a ton of flexibility that is unheard of with other rental companies. In the past, rent would only be raised at most 1x in a 12 month period. Not sure if that's still the case, but my rent hasn't always increased year over year (7 years in, only 3 rent increases), and when it has increased its been extremely reasonable. Because Schottenstein is local to Columbus, they know the market, the local trends, prime areas etc. Having that local touch makes a tremendous difference in the tenant experience.

"EXECUTIVE INVESTMENTS, INC.",US,LONG BEACH,CALIFORNIA,90813,"I was under them for about one or two years. They are the type of management that only keeps a building for the required two years, sells it, and moves on. We requested repairs with them and they sent the most ineffective maintenance team ever. If the repair invoice was too expensive for them, even if under market value, they would cancel further repairs. If repairs were approved they were done in the worst possible cheapest way. They knew the building had leaking problems which then caused black mold to grow but they still rented the spaces. They would advertise an apartment with certain amenities (free fridge, gas, trash, sewer, parking space, etc.) and with a certain price but the moment of filling out the paperwork they would remove the amenities and raise the rent price. They are very unorganized and seem to lose track of what was advertised on their page in regard to the apartments. They had no control over what charges were for what and who had to be paying for them. They as well would just show up to the apartments demanding to come in. If they provided a notice it was within the 24-hour mark but they would state for only one location (like asking for access to the garage) for them this represented the whole apartment. No, if you only state one location that is it. They then would call you non-stop and demand you leave work to open for them. They also lost copies of the keys to our apartment. I had to install cameras to catch them trying to come in and asking them to leave/stating to them at what time I would arrive.

ADVENIR AT WYNDAM,US,LONGMONT,COLORADO,80501,"These guys will never change, they are owned by crooks who are looking to exploit the outrageous housing market in CO. I fell for the cheap price, now we're paying for it.
1. My door has been broken into 3 times now, to which they have LITERALLY ZERO concern for, they kick people out on the street like trash and have never once opened their hot tub since I've lived here (6 months).
There are always vagrants running around through the neighborhood terrorizing the apartment complex - breaking into cars, breaking into apartments, stealing things off balconies etc.
2. They make money off of towing vehicles that are in the same spot for 3 days, or expired plates within the grace period, or your friends visiting, or any other way they can find to tow your car. Not to mention they tow it all the way to Denver so expect to pay more than $400 for a tow.
3. Their leasing staff isn't trained on the restrictions on the lease (which is literally their f*ing job) and they tell you lies before you rent so once you've signed the contract they can threaten to terminate your lease for following the direction of the leasing agent.
4. They don't do a damn thing before you move into the apartment too, all empty apartments have their smoke alarms beeping because THAT is how cheap these people are. When we moved in our dishwasher was leaking all over the floor, the garbage disposal was clogged and didn't work, none of the outlets in the kitchen worked, and its clear they don't paint or clean before they rent because the floors were FILTHY and the toilets had nasty stains, not to mention the rings around the bathtub, and the lock on the front door was broken. They over work and under pay their maintenance people, which is insane for the prices they change compared to the quality of hosing they provide.
5. Since I live on the basement floor I put up lattice for privacy (due to literally every complaint listed above) and also because the leasing agent told us we could, but as soon as I spent $100 to make it nice and look good they threatened to terminate my lease if I don't take it down.",1,1,3,1,1,2023-04-20T15:25:02.040Z,false,,,false

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL,US,BRAINTREE,MASSACHUSETTS,02184,"Equity is reliable. You get what you pay-for. There's an on-site maintenance staff, and they *will* show up if you have an issue. The units are relatively good quality too. I've lived with them a couple times, and while I've sometimes found some things that weren't 100% move-in ready, they've usually fixed them in reasonably short order. They also won't screw you on your security deposit. Small holes, carpet issues, whatever... they re-paint and re-carpet regularly anyway, so as long as you complete your lease and don't do anything too egregious, you *probably* won't see any deductions. I've rented from them several times in several different places and this has usually held true.

HOWEVER, they will raise your rent every year to ""market rate"" - often to the tune of hundreds of dollars. It's all figured out by an algorithm, and the local staff has very little say in it. The only way to get around this is to research rentals in your area, and make a case to the central office that they have priced the unit incorrectly and provide evidence of comparable units at a lower price. If you can do this, they will usually drop the increase, but there will still be an increase. Don't like it? Better get ready to move. It's awful.

Overall, it's a huge trade-off. I'd rate my experience generally positive, but because of their pricing policies, I couldn't recommend them in good conscience to anyone who doesn't have a ton of disposable income. Renter beware.",5,5,1,4,5,2023-04-20T15:27:36.933Z,false,,,false

In less than one year they made so many errors: package was late, scheduled delivery got canceled at the last minute for no reason, lied about you not being at home (I even waited at my door with my phone to record the evidence), missing package, non-existent customer support (no phone call option, all you can do is to create a ticket and wait for their reply).
Despite all the mess, the management staff would insist this is a ""reputable service"" (Google review 1.4 btw), and suggested that ""you had the problems because you didn't use it correctly"" (sure, my fault that their driver failed to deliver and lied).

-barricaded our back door so we wouldn't use it while she tore the deck down. She was scared of injuries/potential lawsuit if we used it. This is illegal (fire code reasons). She doesn't even understand the laws that govern this sort of thing.

- left a bunch of stuff in the basement cause she was too lazy to get rid of it before moving out.

-gave us grief when moving out for not cleaning even though we did. She blamed us for upsetting the new tenants when she wasn't able to set up a cleaning/painting service cause she had them moving in the same day we left as to not miss a single week of rent payments.

MERAJ POURHOSSEIN,CA,WATERLOO,ONTARIO,N2L5P3,"Worst landlord experience of my life. Father and son scammer duo that are not on the same page. Neither know landlord-tenant laws. Rent out their basement illegally. Half the electrical outlets in the house don’t work.

Both show up with no notice and have nothing better to do than sit in common room creepishly waiting to ambush anyone who walks in. Son smokes several substances in the common areas.

Landlord will try to force tenants to do jobs that are the the landlords responsibility, such as shovelling snow off the driveway or clearing phallic shaped graffiti left on their garage left by previous angry tenants.

Took 11 days to fix broken internet, which another tenant did. May pull internet for current month after screaming at you. Yelled at another tenant for “breaking” their old, shitty laundry machine that desperately needs a replacement. 

Will threaten your living situation constantly, try to raise rent with no notice. Both have entered my living space without permission to yell about random things.

PREETI THOMAS/ ISSAC THOMAS,CA,MARKHAM,ONTARIO,L6C1T4,"There are so many issues with the landlords.
1. There house is filthy and infested with rats. After complaining like everyday for 3 weeks nothing they didn’t do anything.
2. There is no concern for privacy. Drunk landlord(Issac) would bang main door in the middle of the night.
3. Cleaning the common area was landlord responsibility and they never did(hired anyone) for it.
4. Internet sucks. And when I complained about it many times Issac verbally abused me. 
5. Landlords lived in Ottawa but they would randomly organize parties in their house in Markham and invite people who had no regards for tenants(drunk Indian men)
6. When we( me and another 2 tenants)decided to leave and broke the lease cause of the abuse mainly, Issac and Preeti used profanities.

So basically I won’t recommend new comers to go there. Trust me you won’t want another stupid headaches.


And there is one more thing I want to mention- Issac randomly left his mother in the house with no bed for her or food or money. She would cry all day and beg you. She doesn’t speak English and it’s difficult to understand. (I used speech to text and then converted in English) this is how I know about her story.

KELLER INVESTMENT PROPERTIES,US,FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA,86001,"Woodcrest Apartments (managed by Keller Investment Properties) is definitely on the bottom end of complexes in the city.  Like any college town, the standards of landlords and property management companies are already very low.  If you intend on moving to Flagstaff and do not own property or do not have connections for housing, be aware that rent prices for what you get are not worth it.

Keller Investment Properties provide the bare minimum for ""luxury"" apartment prices. During our year at Woodcrest Apartments in Flagstaff, the water was turned off 3 to 4 times a month. We were consistently told to fill our bathtubs to be able to flush toilets. The internet provided by the complex went out several times. The only real amenity was a hot tub that was never in operation throughout our entire time at Woodcrest. The management of snow throughout the property during winter was poor. There were cars consistently getting stuck within the parking lots. We had countless issues with management during the move in process such as getting misquoted, lies about renovations and problems with getting our pets properly put into the lease.

Keller Investment Properties does not pay their employees enough. This is evident by the high turnover rate within the office and the general confusion from any questions asked to the staff.

Keller Investment Properties does not put enough money into the infrastructure of their complexes. This is evident by the hot water not working/water not working at all and the internet being extremely sporadic.

Avoid any Keller Investment Properties if at all possible.  For reference they have properties in Utah, Nevada and Arizona. If you are moving to Flagstaff, AZ, avoid Woodcrest Apartments.",2,3,2,4,2,2023-04-20T18:14:24.121Z,false,,,false
HAZELVIEW PROPERITES,CA,LONDON,ONTARIO,N6A3L9,"Workers for the landlord entered my apartment without notice and were upset that I hadn’t set my place up for an inspection so they tore the cushions off my couch and left them on the floor I went into my bedroom and found my mattress flipped off my bed and on the floor — they damaged the box spring and I had to replace it. Over the course of a couple years I had a cockroach and bed bug infestation the pest control company would take over a month to come each time I made a complaint about bugs — they also didn’t seem to be spraying much of my apartment. There was no residue from spraying on a lot of my furniture and only after complaining and accusing the exterminator of not spraying did he start to treat my unit. The landlord never took responsibility for damaging my property and failing to treat the infestation nor would they provide credit to use their laundry room, which is part of the treatment for a bug infestation. Overall I probably spent 5 grand replacing furniture when I left the building. 

The building manager and his supervisor were abusive and acted like tin pot dictators when attempting to get them to actually address the issues outlined above and other issues I have not included. They filed a fraudulent n5 when I started to press them that what they had done was illegal and promptly withdrew the n5 when I easily showed I kept my apartment quite clean.",1,1,3,1,1,2023-04-20T18:45:42.789Z,false,,,false

BO ROTHSTEIN,CA,VANCOUVER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V5T0A4,"Honestly I feel like its gonna look like the landlord himself wrote this, but truly this has been my best landlord experience since moving to Vancouver is 2016.

Bo is extremely quick to act when we need him to. The management company in our building tends to take their time, but Bo is on them super hard and fast when we need anything from them like the buzzer not working.

We have had a ton go wrong in this apartment including 2 floods (not our fault), Dishwasher needing replacement, Washer/Dryer needing replacement. Bo is extremely fast to respond and really gives us the power to do what we want and simply take the cost off of upcoming rent when necessary.

The only thing id mention that may not be for you... Bo is OTHERWISE very hands off when there are no issues. He trusts us and isn't coming in here constantly to inspect the place. I really appreciate that aspect. this also means that for things like replacing a dishwasher for example he leaves that in our hands to find something good.. buy it and have it installed professionally ourselves... and he will then reimburse. We love doing it this way, but I COULD see some being put off by such a thing if say you dont have the ability to put out a big chunk of money like that for a couple weeks. that being said, im sure BO would work with us if it was an issue.

He hasnt raised rent on us in the past three years... which is honestly amazing considering the markets, and I do find commendable. Have never expereicned that in this city before thats for sure!!",5,5,5,5,5,2023-04-20T19:27:17.923Z,false,,,false

SKYLINE LIVING,CA,SARNIA,ONTARIO,N7T6E2,"These jokers buy up literally every apartment complex that they can afford in my city. They then do as many ""improvements"" to the building that they can get away with, letting you know that it could potentially cause an AGI. But they won't even tell you which capital projects they actually will apply for an AGI over, which drives me insane because I can't handle uncertainty. When they bought the place, they told us we would be grandfathered in as smoking units, then like 3 months later they tried to get all of us to sign agreements to make the entire building smoke free. I get it, SOME people don't like the smell of cigarettes or weed, but Skyline's word isn't worth anything, they will always do what will make them the most money. Their customer service is also garbage, all of their communications sound as if they were written by an AI, there is absolutely no rapport or human connection between Skyline's management and their tenants. People who think formal impersonal language is better for a business are delusional, especially when dealing with something as personal as housing. 

The four guys who founded the company are the epitome of toxic masculinity, and it's reflected in how hierarchical and bureaucratic their corporation is. Skyline is simply the manifestation of parasitical investors and their greed.",3,4,1,1,2,2023-04-20T19:33:40.004Z,false,,,false

Q RESIDENTIAL,CA,HAMILTON,ONTARIO,L8P4R3,"I live in a 1bdrm apartment and have been renting for 2 years. $1200 currently. 

Mgmt at 145/165 Queen Street S are great folks at this point in time. The new staff have been responsive in replying to my concerns. (especially if more urgent). However this could change since there's been a fair amount of turnover with staff for my building during my time here.

Unfortunately once things go to Q Residential corporate, little is done in regards to non-urgent repairs. I waited 4+ months for water damage to be fixed on my wall before a subcontractor came. As well, my heat was supposed to be fixed two years ago and hasnt been fixed. All staff have been able to do is put a work order in and much doesnt happen after that. One half of baseboard heating works in my living room, so its quite cold in my unit in the winter (sometimes 16 degrees or lower). This is completely unaccetable and is a by-law violation in my city.

I'm staying here since rent is reasonable considering rental prices in Hamilton. Newly rented 1 bdrm units in my building are going for $1700 now, which is ridiculous for units with continual cockroach problems, and difficult neighbours depending on your floor. (ex: 165 Queen Street S Floor 3, has one neighbour who has been difficult). Mgmt has done alot to resolve things in this regard thankfully, but its still challenging. Mgmt has been proactive in treating my specific unit for cockroaches, but its a continual problem within the building. Other tenants have had bed bug issues, but thankfully I havent had this happen.

Most tenants living in my building are nice folks which helps balance things out considering the frustrations I've experienced here in my stay. Overall wouldnt recommend living here, mainly due to Q Residential headquarters lack of action for major repair problems, and a comprehensive pest control approach.",1,2,2,4,3,2023-04-20T20:45:11.793Z,false,,,false
